HE that goeth about to perfuade it multitude, that they are not ^o well governed as they ought to be (fays the learned and judicious Hooker) *^ fhall never want attentive ana favourable hearers i becaufe fuch as openly reprove < fuppofed diforders of ftate, are taken for principal friends to the conm^on benefit of all, and for men that carry ingulaf ■ *• freedom of mind. Under this fair and ** plaufible colour, whatfoever they utter !* paffeth for good and current. That which wnntcth in the weight of tncir fpccch Is fupplictl by the aptncfs of mens minds to accept aiui believe it. Whereas, on the \" other fide, if wc maintain things that \" are eftabliflied, wc have to ftrive with *' a number of heavy prejudices, deeply \" rooted in the hearts of men, who think that herein wc fcrve the time, and fpeak in favour of the prefcnt ftate, becaufc thereby wc cither hold or feek prefer- \" ment.\" Hence it is that the grofleft ab- furdities pafs for irrefragable arguments in the mouth of a popular declaimer, whilft the clearefl dcdudions of reafon, on the fide of authority, are termed delufive fophiftry, and the artful chicane of a courtier. Hence it is alfo that fo few men of talents are willing to hazard their reputation on the fuccefs of their arguments in defence of go- vernment, or to become volunteers in the caufe of truth, whilfl calumny and falfhood are propagated amongft the people againft their rulers without contradiction, and even fbraetimes with the indolent acquiefcence of men of enlightened underftandings and can- did hearts. Yet furcly the tafk of aflertlng the the rights of government, inaintaining the authority of the fupicmc power over the whole community, of calling hack the mif- guidcd multitude from fiidVious combinations, and perfiiading them to unite in promoting the public happinefs, by yielding a chcarful obedience to the laws, and cheriihing a zealous attachment to our excellent conflitu- tion, ought not to be left to the pancgyrifts of miniflcrs, to thofe only who \" hcjld or \" feek preferment.\" Is it the duty of the hirelings of an adminiflration only, to inionn the people of the extent of their rights, and to exhort them to their dutv ? To ex- pofe the malevolent defigns, and detedt the artifices of their feducers ? To point out to them the dangers which belet them, and the fatal confequences which hang over rhcm ? To fliew to them the hazard they run of lofing their fubftantial liberty, by purfuing the ignus fatiais which they have been de- luded to follow ? Shall we fee our fellow- fubje^^s in the Colonies intoxicated with a fond conceit of their own importance, and charmed by the flattering whifpers of in- dependency, forfaking the guide of their B 2 ^Olitk^ yculb, the fare flay of all their liberties, nnd the protcdor of all their rights and pofief- iions, the parliament of Great Britain j and throwing thesnfelvcs into the arms of pre- rogative, and putting all their confidence in the good pleafure of tlic crown ? Is the Biitidi empire to he fuffered to be rent in pieces, and each member of it expofed to become a prey to its powerful n'Jghbour, from a vain imagination that there is no fu- preme power in the flate, which has au- thority to command the ftrength, the riches, and the fwords of all the fubjotfls of the realm, to defend every part of ita dominions, and to protedt the rights and pofleiTions of every individual who lives un- der it ? Are we to fold our hands, and fub- mit ourfelves to the preiTure of thefe cala- mities, becaufe the followers of a minifler do not think the caufe of their patron con- cerned, or his ftability endangered, or be- caufe the fliafts of calumny and dctracftion are ready to be launched againft whoever is hardy e. uugh to endeavour to flop the mad- nefs of the people? ' ■ ,-^ - *. • - - Far I'iir be It from tnc to willi to be tboiu at infcnliblc to the f?;ood or ill opinion ot niy countrymen j but as I conlklcr it to be my duty to promote tbeir welfare to the iit- nioll of mv poor ability, I will jhciv them my opinion^ whether they may reward or cenfurc me for my endeavours. On this principle, and acftuatcd by ihcfe mo- tives, it is, that, un awed by the terrors which rife before mc, I adventure upon my prefcnt undertaking j and I fet down to review the American controverfy, with the finglc, and 1 hope honcft, piirpofe of bring- ing back my fcllow-fubjeds in the Colonies to a juil fenfe of their duty to the fupreme Icgillative power, by expofing to them the fallacies by which they have been deluded, and exploring the dangers which the paths wherein they are now bewildered muft un- avoidably lead them into. The feveral pleas which have been urged by thcfe who have diltingullned themkives in this controverfy, on behalf of the Colo- nies, may be comprehended under thefe two general heads : The title of the inhabitants in the Colo- pies to all the rights, liberties, and privi^ ieges of Engliflimen ; and their claim to exemption from the jurifdidion of parlia^ It (liould feem to be of the utmofl: im- portance to the Colonies, that the former plea was eflablifhed before they adduced any proofs in fupport of the latter ; for, fhould they fail in the one, nothing could be more fatal to their freedom, and confequently tQ their profperity, than their fucceeding in the other. .; .. M If they fhould unhappily be able to de-r monftrate, that the Colonies are no part of the Britifh flatej that they are the king's domain, and not annexed to the realm j that the inhabitants are not Britifti fubjeds, nor within the jurifdidion of parliament; they can have no title to fuch privileges and jpamimities as the people of England derive un^er under a£ls of parliament, noi* to any other of thofe rights which are peculiar to Britifli fubjcdls within the realm. What would then be their fituation it behoves them well to confider; and before they rejedl the au- thority of parliament, they ought ferioufly and difpaflionatcly to weigh the confe- quences, and be very well affured, that whilft they arc labouring to free themfelves from the prefent inconveniencies, which the jurif- did:ion of parliament fubjedls them to, they do not, by avoiding them, run into difficul- ties much more embarrafling, and expofe themfelves to hardfhips much more into- lerable. They ought to refledt, that what- ever may be their condition, they cannot ap- ply to parliament to better it. If they rejed: the jurifdi<fi:on of parliament, they muft not in any cafe fue for its interpofition in their behalf. Whatever grievances they may have to cpmplain of, they muft feek redrefs from the grace of the crown alone ; for, fhould they petition parliament to do them right, they themfelves have authorized the crown to tell parliament, as the fecretary of ftate to James the Firil; did the houfe of commons, B ^ \" Ame- <« America Is not annexed to the realm, nor ** within the jurifdidlion of parliament, you *' have therefore no right to interfere.\" ii * ill Such being the cafe, we are therefore to exped to find the ftrongeft efforts of the colony advocates directed to this point. We may indeed look for the clearcft evi- dence, the mod convincing arguments, and even demonftrative proofs of their right to thefe privileges, independent of ads of parliament, lince we fee them fo eager to preclude parliament from the power of con- veying to them any privilege whatever. Let us then fee on what they found their In May 1765, the houfe of burgeffes in Virginia refolved, \" That the firfl adventurers <c and * To free the text from the embarraffinent of long quotations, and to prevent the reader's attention from being carried off to other obje<5ls, I have here inferted only fuch of the feveral afTem biles refolutions as have relation to the fubjedl: of the prefent enquiry. But in juftice to the aflemblies, I have given entire copies of ihtir rerolutlons in the appendix^ (C cc « <c and fcttlers of this his majefty's colony and dominion of Virginia, brought with them and tranfmitted to their pofterity, and all other his majefty's fubjefts fince inha- biting in this his majefty's faid colony, all the liberties, privileges, franchifes, and immunities, that have at any time beea held and enjoyed, and poiTefTcd by the people of Great-Britain.\" This refolution is adopted by the affembly of Maryland, and repeated in the very fame words: and as the alTembly of Virginia has been faid to have hung out the ftandard for American liberty, and the other Colonies Jiave little more merit than that of following their leader, I muft confefs I expedted to have found a muc/j clearer proof of the truth of the propoiition contained in their refolu- tion than I am able to colled: from the terms in which it is exprefied. They tell us indeed \" That the jirfl adve?tturers m \" the reign of James the Firft, brought \" with them, atid tranjmltted to their *' poJ}erif)\\ &c. all the liberties, privileges, *' franchifes, and immunities, that the people . : \" of ** of Great-Britain have at any time (fince \" as well as before) enjoyed and polTefled.\" But in what fort of mcnjlrmim^ jiuckomy or embryo^ it was that they carried with them to Virginia, in the reign of James the FirfT:, the habeas corpus ad:, which the pe* pie of England did not enjoy or poflefs till the reign of Charles the Second ', or the bill of rights, which they did not enjoy till the reign of William and Mary ; the ad:s for altering the fucceflion and the limitation of the crown, and many others pafTed in that and the fubfequent reigns ; as they have not condefcendcd to inform their friends in England, fo they can only exped: us to ad- mire their profound logical fl^ill, and muft content themfclves with the more rational applaufe of their countrymen, who they may have more fully intruded, , t ' ? .. ' ' ' .' * ■ The aflembly of Pennfylyania, by their refolutions in the fame year, declare, \" That the inhabitants of this province are intitled to all the liberties, rights, and privileges of his majefty's fubjeds in Great-Britain, or ciJe\"Mierc 3 and that the conflitution of <' govern«- (C cc <e ti f 1 « government In this province is founded on <* the natural rights of mankind, and the \" noble principles of Englifh liberty, and «« therefore is or ought to ht perfcBly free,^* This refolution afTerts in like manner, as do the refoiurjon? of Virginia and Maryland, that the people of that colony are mfitlcd to all the rights oi Biitifli fubjcdls ; but u does not pretend (hat they?;-/? felthrs carrii.-' t fhcai there: neiher does it found :heir claim to them upon the rovalchartci to the proprietor, or upon rhe laws ot Great-Britain, but upon the \" natural rights of mankind, and the *' noble principles of Englilh liberty.\" . That the natural rights of manki?2(l (hould give any people a right to all the liberties and privileL;es of Englillimen, is, I believe, a dodlrine unknown to all civilians, except the affembly of Pcnnlylvania It is indeed a mofl benevolent dodrine; lor if it be eftablifhed, it will render the bleffings which Britifli fub- jedls enjoy under their excellent conftitution univerfal to all people, at leaft to all thofc who live under any conftitution of govern- nient which is founded upon the natural rights of mankind, in whatever part of the world they may inhabit, or whoever may be their fovereign. The native Indians in North America, the Hottentots at the Cape of Good Hope, the Tartars, Arabs, Cafres, andGroen- landers, will all have an equal title to the liberties and rights of Engliflimen, with the people of Pennfylvania j for all their confti- tutions of government are founded on the natural rights of mankind. s III The nohle principle of EngUjJj liberty is, however, another and more peculiar founda- tion for the conftitution of the government in Pennfylvania J but where to find thefe noble principles of Englifli liberty, except it be in the laws of the land, 1 confefs I am ignorant : and if the aflembly of Pennfyl- vania got them elfewhere, it would have been kind in them to have informed the world whence they had them, that other nations might have drawn from the fame precious fountain. But, not to prefs too hard upon fuch tender ground, the confequence of their difcovering thefe nobles principles, and of :n \" been itions lupon and of having founded their conflitutlon of government upon them, it feems is, that \" the conflitution of government in Penn- \" fjlvania is or ought to be pcrfc5lly free\" To be pcrfc5lly free is, I apprehend, to be in a flatc of nature abfolutely independent of, and uncontrolaMe by, any other, in all cafes whatever : and when applied to ftates, is the moft complete definition of equality and independency that can be given. It excludes all poflibility of a fuperior or para- mount, and furnifhes us with a full idea of fupreme and unlimited jurifdiftion. No law of another flatc can have force within that territory, nor can the inhabitants be amenable to any foreign judicature. No a6t whatever of the Britifh parliament is or ought to be therefore of force in Penn- lylvania, otherways the government of that country (I mufl not henceforth call it pro- '■oince^ for that term implies dependence) cannot be, as it is or ought to be^ perfedly free. The ad: of the 7th and 8th of king William, which declares, that *^ all laws, \" bye-laws, ufages, and cuftoms, which ftiali \" be in pradice in any of the Plantations, *' repugnant repugnant to any law made or to be made in this kingdom relative to the faid Plan- tations, {hall be void and of none cfFedt,\" is plainly inconfiflent v^ith i\\\\\\s perfeSl freedom of the Pennfylvania conftitution of govern- ment, and therefore it is not^ or ought not to be, of force : neither inc! \"'^.d ought the adl of . the 5th of George the Second, which makes the lands in America aflets for the payment of debts, nor any other of the feveral a6ls of parliament which relate to the Plantations, to be executed within the jurifdidtion of the government of Pennfylvania. Had the Examitier of the Claim of the Colonies been acquainted with this refolution when he wrote 1 ;s pamphlet, he probably would not have given fo much offence to the author of The Confiderations on the Propriety of impojing TaxeSy as that gentleman has taken, at his producing afts of parliament in evidence of the right of parliament to difpofe of the property of the people in Pennfylvania and the other American Colonies, for that refo- lution abrogates them all alike. None of them is or ought to be of force within that governments and inftead of cenfuring the chief ft i' Plan- yeedom not to adl of yment ations, d the len he hor of at his the refo- that chief n 4 r '5 1, chief jiifllcc fur denying the authority of one adl of parliament, when he admitted the authority of fo many others, he would have blamed him for having admitted the authority of any, perhaps have accufed him in io doing of denying the perfe^ freedom of the conJUtution of the government of Pennfyhania, We now fee the rcafon of the aflertion in the former part of this refolution : \" that the \" conftitution of the government is founded <' on the natural rights of mankind;\" and the inference drawn therefrom, that all man- kind have a natural right to the liberties, privileges, &c. of Britifh fubjedts : for if that be not the cafe, it will be impofliblc for the people of Pcnnfyivania to have any right to fuch of them as are contained in at5ts of parliament, becaufe thofe adls cannot, or at leaft ought not^ as we have feen, to have any force there. ^ The aflembly of Mafia chufcts Bay fup- port their claim to all the rights and privi- leges of Britidi fubjecls by the following refolucions, entered upon their journaib the 29th of Odober 1765. .., . ,\".

Far be it from me to deny to the inhabitants of Mailachufcts a participation in and oi fuch rights and privi- leges as Britifli fubjeAs are intitled to in common with all mankind, or fuch as we de- ' \" \" C rive rive from the laws of God or Nature, Such rights they arc certainly intitled to, as they arc men, and as they arc Chriftians ; but all men, and all Chriftians, arc not intitled to the rights and privileges of cwcry pan icular jociety of which they are not member i orfubje&s. Every fociety has rights and privileges pecu- liar to thofe who compofc that fociety j and when we treat of the rights and privileges of the members of that fociety, we muft be iinderftood to mean ftich privileges as are peculiar to that fociety, and not fuch as are the common rights and privileges of all Chriflian men. When therefore we are diicufiing the 7-ighis and privileges of Britifi fubjcBsj wc mull: confine our enquiries to fuch rights as a natural-born fubjedt of the Briti/h fociety or flate is intitled to, and to which an alten^ or one who is not a member of that fociety, has no claim. The laws of God or of Nature, or the covimon rights of mankind, cannot therefore give the inhabit- ants of MalTachufets any title to the peculiar privileges of Britifh fubjecSls, if they are not alfo members of the Britifh community or ftatc.

Reafon and common fenfe arc faculties of the mind, by which the truth or falf- hood»-of any propofition is tried, but they are not in themfelves either principles or propolitions ; when therefore we fliall have tried and examined the feveral propolitions on which the colony alTemblies found their claim t*: all the rights and privileges of Bri- tifli fubjedls, we fliall then fee W'hether they are intitled to them in reafin and (vnimoH fenfe, or not. A nyal charter, it muft be allowed, conveys^ a clear title to whatever it is in the right or prerogative of the crowh to ... ,.

The king of England, or any other king, may grant to any people vi^ho are their fubjedts rights and privilegesy^/Tz/y^/r to thofe enjoyed by the people of Great Britain ; but no authority, other than the fupreme Icgiflature of Great Britain, can incorporate any individual or people into the Britidi community, or make them partakers of tlie rights and privileges of Britifli fubjedls. If the inhabitants of MalTachufets are not theicf^'-e the natural born fubjeds of the realm of Great Britain, and a part of the Britifli community, the king cannot by any a<5l of his aLne natu- ralize them, or give them a title to the rights and privileges of Britifli fubjeds, . ... An a^ of parlmme?it is indeed a fufficient authority to convey to any people who acknow- ledge its fupremacy, the rights and privileges of British fubjeds i but I little expeded to have le king 5 rights thority, dual or ■ivileges natural ity, the e rights ifficient leges of feea , [ 21 ] fcen an ad of parliament appcvlcd to by the alTembly of Maflachufets, as having con- veyed to them any rights or privileges, when at the fame time they are denying that par • liament has any jurifdidlion over them whatever. But it feems parliament has a right to benefit the colonies, but not to hind them : it may give them bounties^ but it muft not impofe burdens. Its power over the colonies is fomewhat like that allowed by the deifts to the Almighty over his creatures, he tnay reward them with eternal happinefs if he pleafes, but he muft not punifli them on any account. Parliament however, I am afraid, will not be conient with fuch a power, and I would not ?dvife the Colonies to rely too much upon its goodnature; for if it fliould find itfelf to have been miftaken in ranking the inhabitants in the Colonies among the fubjeds of the realm, and that it has granted the privileges and immunities of Britifh fubjeds to thofe who are not of the Britifh commu- nity, and difavov^ its authority over them 5 there might be dangei of its recalling that gram, and declaring by another act of par- liament, that the rights and privileges of Bri- C 3 i\\(h ti(h fubje6ls fhall not extend to the Colc-» nies. Even the principles of common juftice, which is the laft pillar of the MaiTachufets aflemblies title, would demand this of par- pnent; for it is the highefl injujlice that thofe who will not fhare in the burdens of the community, nor be bound by its laws, ihould partake of its benefits, and enjoy its privileges in common with thofc who are its members. The alTembly of New York introduce iheir refolutions of the i8th of December, 1765, with a declaration of \" their faith and allegiance to his majefty king George the Third, and of their jubmijjion to the Jti^ ^* prem: legijlctive power^' undertaking at the fame time to fhew \" that the rights \" claimed by them, are in no manner in^ ^' confijlent with either,'' Had the fubfequent refolutions been conceived in the fame fpi- jit with this introdudlion, I iliould have been happy in applauding the wifdom of the affembly J^t New York, and have propofed ^heir pxample for the inftrudion and imita- pf all the other Colonics. But all that not been urged again (l our claims, cry the Colony advocates, are novel doctrines, we will not difpute about them ; all we defire and fue for is o\\iv for\" tner liberties j we are loyal fubjcdts of the king, and only defire to be i-cjiored to our ancient rights^ as we quietly enjoyed them before the fatal period of Mr. Grenville's adminiftration. What were thofey^rwir or ancient rights and priii leges cj the Colo- nies fliall then be the fubjev5t of our next enquiry. But by the way, I would afk the fe loyal fubjedts of the king, what king it is they profefs themfelvcs to be the loyal fubjeds of ? It cannot be his prefent mod gracious majefty George the Third, King of Great Britain, for his title is founded on an ad: of parliament, and they will not furcly acknowledge, that parliament can give them a king, which is of all others the higheft ad of fovereignty, when they deny it to have power to tax or bind them in any o- thercafe; and I do not recollc£lt that there is any ad of aflembly in any of the Colo- nies for fettling: the crown upon King Wil- rious houfe of Hanover. ng liam, or the illufl; But they fay, they recognized his majefty's L title ' ■•' 'i' :, t ■lit' title before many of the people In Engljini had done it. That is, they obcyd an ad: of parli;iment before it was obeyd by many people in England. I believe they did fo, for I never fufpedled them of Jacobitifm, altho' they muft fee, that if they rejedt parliamentary authority, they make them- felvcs to be ftill the fubjeds of the abjured Stuart race. This however is too delicate a matter to fay more upon ; we fliall then proceed to the invefligation of their ^/j- cient rights, 6cc. The firft charter granted by the crown of England for the purpofe of Colonization, is that granted by king James to the two Virginia Companies, dated the loth of April, 1606; thofe which precede it ha- ving been granted for the purpofe of Dif- covcry. This charter, as it is explained and enlarged by another charter, dated on- ly three years after, furnifhes us with a pretty good account of the rights and pri- vileges which the iirfl: Settlers in Virginia carried over with them, and to which they now feem fo defirous of recurring. By one claufe in this charter, the governor, and and other magiftratcs and officers to be ap- pointed by a council rcfiding in London, arc vcftcd '* with full and ahfohite power \" and authority to corrcB, punijl\\ and par- •* don^ govern and rule all fuch the fubjcds •' of us, our heirs and fuccellbrs, as fliall ** from time to time adventure themfelvcs ** in any voyage thither, or that iball at •* any time inhabit in the piecindts and *' territories of the faid Colony as aforefaid, ** according to fuch orders, ordinances, con- ** Jlitiiiions, dire^icm and inflructionSy as by our [aid council as aforefaid AkiII be efta- blifhed ; and in deject thereof, in cafe of ** nccejjity, according to the good difcretion ** of the faid governors and cheers refpec- \" tively, as well in cafes capital as civil, ** both marine and others, lo always as the \" faid ftatutes, ordinances and proceedings, ** as near as conveniently may be, be agree- •* able to the laws, ftatutcs, government \" and policy of this our realm of England.\" By other claufes, the treafurcr and com- pany are exempt from the payment of all duties and taxes ^ox f even years * But a du- ty of two and an half per cent, is laid by the king upon all merchandize, bought and L 2 fold H!l [ 140 ] fold within the precincts of the Colony, hy Englifh fubjcdts not of the Colony. And an additional duty of Two and an half per cent, more is laid upon all merchandize bought or fold therein by aliens or foreign- ers, and the revenue to arifc from thofe duties is thus appropriated by the king ; ** all which fums of money or benefit as afbrc- faid, for and during the fpace of twenty- one years next v.ifuing the date hereof* fliall be wholly employed to the ufe, be- nefit and behoof of the faid feverai plan- tations where fuch traffic fliall be made ; and after the faid twenty-one years end- ed, the fame fliall be taken to the ufe cfuj, cur heirs end jucccjjbrsy by fuch officers and minifters as by us, our heirs and fuccef- fors, fliall be thereunto appointed.\" In a claufc of the fccond charter this duty is doubled, but it is explainea to mean a du- ty of Five per cent, upon goods imported, and Five per cent, on goods exported by Englifli fubjeds not of the Colony, or al- lowed by the company ; and Ten per cent, ens, ** over and abt it << <c (( t< <( ic <( <( <( <( by fuch ft €( futfidy and cuflom as the faid company is or hereafter fiall be to pay!' The glorious rightSy rights, frhilegci and immttnitics therefore, which the Jirjl Sett Lis in V i r[^l n ia f^/rr/V^ *with them, appear to have I ,cn the right of heing governed hy laws, enadted by a coun- cil of the proprietors rcfiding here in Eng- land, all of them nominated in the firft in- ftance by the crown, and afterwards to be clecftcd by the proprietors refiding in Eng- land. And in cafe of the dtjcci o^ Jtich Jla- tutt's, the difcrction of the governor, and o- ther minifterial oificers, was to be the Lsv, as well m cafes aipita/as civil. It was their right and privilege alfo, to be taxed by the King's Jb/f prerogative, for the u/e and dc^ Jit of the crown only, and in no cafe to be taxed by themfelves, or their reprefen- tatives eledled by themfelves ; for thefe charters convey no fuch powers to the com- panies, or. to their council. So very far from the truth therefore arc thofe afTertions of the Virginia aflembly contained in their refolutions, ** that the inhabitants of that Colony have always beefi taxed by them- felves, or by perfons chofen by them- felves J and of having been governed on-^ ly hy fuch laws, as they or their repre- ^ntatives gave confent to; \" that by the L 3 origi- original conftltutlon of the Colony, the inhabitants had no right to chult reprefen- tatives for any purpofe, or of being con- fulted, or their conlent afked in the fram- ing of any laws, or impofing of any taxes, by which they were bound. Their laws were fent over to them from England rea- dy drawn up, and enadted by a coi'ncil ap- pointed by the crown, and their taxe^ were impofed by the kings fole prerogative. Nor were thefe the rights and privileges of the inhabitants of that country, which is novV called Virginia only,for the territory granted by thefe charters to the two Virginia com- panies extended from the latitude 34 to the latitude 45, which includes the whole country, from the fouth boundary of the C&lony of Virginia, t;o the frontiers of No- va.,S,cotia, and the firft Settlers in that nnrt ofc this territory, which is now called New England, fettled under thofe very charter s^ having purchafed tlie right fo to do from owQ, of thofe comp.anies^ ,_ .. .•,• And altho' the New England company ■ took upon them, in their general court, to • afiefs the inhabitants, yet, as their char4f!,r « gave ■.f'; gave them no right Co to do, we iind their havi?ig levied money of the tnhahttants^ one of the chief a6ts of dehnqucncy aliedged in the writ of fctre facias y ilTued againft their charter in the 36th year of the reign of Charles the Second, and upon which judg- ment was given in the court of King's, Bench, againft the governor and company of that Colony, and their charter taken a- way. And when after the revolution they petitioned king William and queen Mary for a renewal of their former charter, the king's council of that great cer:» Lcl-i them, their former charter was infufficient for their purpofe; inafmuch as by it they could not'levey money for the purpofes of their government. And in the new charter, which wac- granted them in the third year of William and Mary, and which is the charter under which that Colony is no'U) go- 'vernedy the power to levy taxes is reftrainecl to provincial and local purpofes, and to be exerciibd over fuch only as are inhabitaiits ov proprietors of the faid Province; the terms of the charter ave thefe ; \" and we do give **'and grant that the faid general court or 'alTembly fhall have f.ill power and au- L 4 ** thority CC ,■ i ■■ : ii: I m-l t ! ) I \" tbority to name and fettle annually all ** civil officers, &c. and alio to impofe ** fines, mnlcfts, imprifonments and other \" punilhments, and to impofe and levy proportionable and reafonable affelf- ments, rates and taxes upon the ejiates andp rfo/is, of all a fid every the proprietors or inhabitants cj our faidProvitice or territory, to be ifTued and difpofed of, by warrant under the hand of the governor of our ** faid Province for the time being, with *' the advice and confent of the council, ** for curfcrvice, in the fieccjjhfy defence and ** fiip^'Ort of our government ^ of our faid Fro* ** vince or territory^ and the protection andpre^ *' fcrvaticn of the inhabitants there ^ accord- ** ing to fuch ads as are or fhall be in force ** within our faid Province\". Here we have the origin of the American diftinc- tion between external and internal taxes, and the diflindllon is a real one in refpedt to the authority or right of the aflembly of MalTachufet' Bay, for that aflembly has no right, by their charter, to lay any tax on Englilh traders, or their goods, frequent- ing the ports of that Province jiot inhabit, s or proprietors , if they be of the Pro- vincc ; and if they have done any fuch thing, their prefent charter nnay be as much endangered by it, as their former one was in the reign of Charles the Second, from their taxing the inhabitants without autho- rity. And the reafon of this limitation in their right of levying taxes is plainly this. That it might not be in their power to in- jure the trade of England by taxing Englifh goods, fhips, or merchants, who might come to trade there, or to give any prefer- ence to the inhabitants of the Colony over the people of England. Thus this boafted diftindion, by which it was pretended, that parliament was precluded from taxing the inhabitants of that Colony :, comes out to he a preclujion of the affejjihly of that Provhice, from taxi?ig Englifi traders or their merchan\" dife in any of the ports of that Province, The purfuit of this bufinefs has carried me to a lower period of time, than other confiderations will fuffer me to proceed from, and I inuft now re- turn to the proceedings of the Virginia company, and of parliament relative to them. And indeed, from what we have feen of h of the conditions, under which the firft Emegrants fettled in that country, we are not to be furprifed at finding petitions to parliament, from thefe iirfl: Settlers in the Colonies fo early as the year 1621 ; and if, as the adminiJiratio?i of the coJo^ nies tells us, parliament then dcjijled from its claim of right over them, we can fcarcely fuppofe the petitioners conlidered that ncgleSl of them as a prhikge. Is it not more probable, that they confidered it as an addition to all their other grievances ? And how would they be amazed at the mad- nefs of tlieir defcendants, whom parliament hath taken under its benign protedion, and refcued from the cruel fluigs of prerogative arid arbitrary power. Did thty fee them labouring with all their might fo throw ofF the juvifdidion of parliament, and retura ' under the unlimited authority of the Parliament, however, did not neglcdi \\Si€\\t applications, nor did parliament, either^ then, or at any time fince, ever doubt of -its right ofjuriJdiBion over the lands and inhabit tants in America^ as will appear riioft evi- dently from the commons journals, faith- ful extrads from which I have given in the appendix beginning at the year 1 6 14, which was only eight years after the grant of the firfl: charter, and only nve years after the grant of the fecond, for planting Colonies in America. .v \"^ . it My countrymen will there fee, that the doubts oithe Hg/jt of parliament to make laws to bind the CoIofpVs, was raifed by the king's fecretary, and that tht- only members of the houfe of commons, who' feemed to doubt along with him, were two^of the patentees^ Mr. Smith and Mh Guy. The majority of the commons, were fo far from doubting of their jurifdidion, that they pafTed the bill, which occafioned the doubt, which was not only ^<?r//;/^ their right, h\\3X2.Q:\\x2X[y exercifmg it, as far as any houfe of parliament can exer- cife any legiflative jurifdiction. And what is ftillmorev the fecretary and the patentees feem to hftve not only acquicfcccnwxh^xi^x. claimed by- parliament, but id have been drawn over to the opinion, that parliament had fuch a right, for in the progrefs of the bill, we find tJiem filent upon the matter of right, and iri m i»! and complaining of the hardfhips impofed by it on the Settlers, by authorifing and giv- ing a right to the Englifli fifhermen to cut down timber oS their lands, and without pay- ing them for it, even within a quarter of a mile of their houfes : And propofmg fome amendments in favour of the colonics : Without 'whichy Mr. Secretary fays, he doubts whither the bill will recei/e the royal aflent. But thefe comnions of England were not to be led by the king's fccretary from their duty to the flate j they rejecSted the pro- vifoes s upon this truly parliamentary reafon, \" that the fi(hing was more ** beneficial to the coim7ionwealth than \" the plantation \". Upon the fame prin- ciple they controuled a patent, which ex- cluded Englifh fiflicrmen from fifliing on certain coafts of America, and declared in right of their fupreme authority, that the penalties and forfeitures inflided by that patent were w/V. They will alfo find in the fame journal, that the commons of England were not inattentive to the profpc- rity and fecurity of the Colonies from their firfl fettlement, nor to preferve to them their \\V\\ their r'lglJs as JubjeSls of England, whilil they took care to prevent them from inter- fering with, or injuring their fellow fub- jedts in their mother country. For they not only allowed the ufe of Virginia tobacco, when they excluded that of all other places, but the forfeiture which the king had by his patent inflidledon the ioh^ccoJJjipped in Vir^ ginia, they declared to be illegal^ and the patent void bccauje it was not done by aittho^ rity of parliament. This was at once refcu- ing the Colonies from the opprellive jurif- didion of the crown, and declaring their own authority over them. It was faying, that the crown alone had no right to grant away the property of the people in Virgi- nia, for that right was m king and parlia- ment. It was declaring, that the Colonies lay within the realm, and were not the pri- vate pofTeflions of the king, but part and parcel of the dominions of the crown, that the inhabitants were fubjedls of the ftate, and intitled to the protection afforded by the laws of England, againft the arbitrary ad:s of the king, and bound to pay obedience to It is well wortlvv of remark, that the ex- cluding parliuinent, iVom juiifdicStion over the Colonics, was at ibis timr a matccr of pecuniary, as well as Iionorary confidcra- tion with the crown j for as there was then no fettled revenue for the fupport of the king's civil government, the grant of char- ters and monopolies were the moft impor- tant of the king's methods of raifing money independant of parliament ; and from the efpecial provifions in thefe charters to the Virginia companies, it is evident, that the king then looked to the new plantations in America, as a fource for a confiderable revenue to himfclf andhis fucceflbrs, which might, perhaps, enable them to fubfift their houfeholds in future, without the dif- agreeable aid of parliament. In thefe cir- cumftances it is more eafy to fuppofe, that the king or his minifters, would have re- trained parliament in its rightful jurifdic- tion, than have fuffered it to ajjiime jurif- did::on over America, if parliament had not a right to it ; and the frequent rejec- tion of the fifhing bill is a proof, that fuch was really the intention of the crown, where- as its frequent renewal is a like proof of an an early jealoufy in the commons, and of their flri<5t attention to the rights of par- liaments, and the true intereds of their In the year 1632, Lord Baltimore ob- tained a grant of lands in America, to which the charter gives the name of Mary- land ; thefe lands were included in the for- mer charters to the Virginia companies, but thofe companies not having cultivated or planted them, the crown thought it had a right to regrant them without any legal procefs ; and as the Virginia companies had held thofe lands as of the manor of Eafl Greenwich, fo the king now grants them to Lord Baltimore, to be holden as of the ** caftle of Windfor in the county of Berks,'* declaring, \" that the faid Province, tenants ** and inhabitants of the faid Coiony or ** country, (hall not from henceforth be \" held or reputed a member, or as part of ** the land of Virginia, or of any other Co- ** lony whatfoever, nor (hall be depending ** on, or fubjedl to their government in any ** thing.

Virginia, Barbadoes, and fome other of the Colonies, (not New England, for that M Colony Colony took part with the commonwenlth's men) had declared for King Charles the Second, and Prince Rupert had carried his fleet to fupport them. To pimlp thefe Colonies, the parliament made an adl in the year 1630, the preamble to which, is as follows : * ** Whereas in Virginia, and in ** the idands of Barbadoes, Antigo, St. *' Chriftophers, Mevias, Montfcrrat, Ber- *' mudas, and divers other illands and •* places in America, there have been and <* are Colonies and Plantations which were ** planted at the coft, and fettled by the people, and by authority of this nation^ which are and ought to ht fubordinate to ** and dependent upon England^ and hath ever ** fmce the planting thereof, been and ought to be jubjeB to fuch lawSyOrders and regulations, as are or Jhall be made by the parliament of England.\" I do not quote this adt as of force or binding lip^n the Colonies, I only give it as an hiftorical facft, containing the opinion of that parliament ; and if We believe the aflertions in the preamble : •* That the Colonies were always held and •* deemed to be fubjeSi to all adfs of par Ha- *t €« <( <( <( * Appendix^ No. 2. (( ment,' •'• tmntt* which is a matter that muH; have been well known to thofc who made that aflcrtion, as the firft fcttlcmcnts were made within the memory of many of them, it will be full -evidence, of the opinion which former parliaments had of their right to jurifdidion over the Colonies, though it is not a proof of the right of thofe who palled TVc great event which quickly followed, and bywhich the conftitution was reflored to its ancient form, reftored parliament to its legal authority over all the fubjeds of the realm, and the re-eftabliflunent of peace af- forded an opportunity for cxercifing it j and fro-rv this happy period, down to the pre- fent tmies, there are but few fclfions which are not marked by fomc adt of fovercignty over the Colonies, fomc rcgulatioji or tax. The Colonies were then indeed become of confiderable importance. The number of inhabitants upon the continent of America, was not now only 4000, which was the number of all the fettlers there in the reign of James the Firft, when the Irifh bill was firfl brought in ; and it therefore behoved .1. % M 2 par- parliament more attentively to look -sSxtt them at this time, than it was neceflary for them to do in their infancy 5 and from this reign it is, we are to begin our enquiries after parliamentary regulation for the trade and inhabitants of the Colonies, althoujih the claim and exercife of the right of par- liament over them, may be taken much higher, and is indeed, as we have feen, coeval with their firfl fettlement. The crown too defifted from its claim to the fole property in the Colonies and right of jurif- di(ftion over them. We hear no more of that prerogative language from the crown to pari' ment j the Colonies are not an- nexed to the realm, they are the king's fc- parate dominions i but, on the contrary, we find the crown, in its future charters and patents for granting territories in America, carefully explaining itfelf to have no preten- fions to fuch fjparate jurifdidion, but fel- ting forth to the Colonies, that parliament was in all cafes to be the fupreme and fo- vereign legillature over them. I fhall here ftop my refearches into the po- litical hiftory of the Colonics, and of the condudt which has been held by parliament and miniftry towards them. And let me now afk the advocates for their indepen^ dency, upon which period of this hiftory it is, that they would fix, as the epocha of the Colonies emancipation from the fove- reign authority of the fupreme legiflature of the realm, or where will they carry us for thofe pretended rights and privileges which exempt them from its jurifdidi^n ? We have fought for them in the flatute books, but we found them not -, we have looked for them in the conduft of a long fcries of miniflers -, and in the opinions of the truly learned and great lawyers, that were of council to our kings, in the pad ages, and lo, they are not there. Where then (hall we hope to meet with them ? In extra- extravagant declamations and unfounded ar- guments. In the weak artifices of party* and in thv fludied mifreprefentations of defigning and interefted men. ' And, \" are tbcfe thy gods, O IfraelV Was it by fuch miferable fophiftry, and unintelligible jargon, that you my fcllow- fubjeds in the Colonies, have been de- luded into the abfurd and vain attempt of exchanging the mild and equal govern-* ment of the laws of England, for preroga-» tive mandates i of feeking to inlarge your liberties, by disfranchifing yourfelvcs of the rights of Britifh fubje(5ts. Where would your madnefs carry you ? or at what point will your frenzy fuffer you to ftop ? Will you renounce your claim to the title and privileges of Englilhmen, and cut your- felves off from the protedion and benefits peculiar to the fubjcdts of the Britifh ftate ? Will you relinquifh the fifliery, and reftore it to the inhabitants of the deferted weftern coafts of England ? Will you expofe your trading fliips to the depredations of the Barbary Corfairs, or fubjedt your produ(5ts to the heavy and prohibitory impofitions of rapacious minidcrs in foreign countries ?
