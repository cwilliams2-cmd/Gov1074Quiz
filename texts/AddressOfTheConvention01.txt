 Massachusetts-Bay; and we now submit it to your candid ConsiderationIt is your Interest to revise it with the greatest Care and Circumspecuonand it is your undoubted Right, either to propose such Alterations and Amendments as you shall judge proper, or, to give it your own Sancionin its present Form, or, totally to reject it. March 1780 435 Question, an Advantage may arise from a Variety of Sentiments offeredbeofto public Examination concerning it. But wise Men are not apt to be obstinately tenacious of their own Opinions: They will always pay a due Regard to those of other Men and keep their minds open to Conviction. We conceive, that in the present instance, by accommodating ourselves tocach other, and individually yielding particular and even favorite Opintons of smaller moment, to essential Principles, and Considerationsgeneral Utility, the public Opinion of the Plan now before you may consolidated.-But without such mutual Condescension in unimportant Matters, we may almost venture to predict, that we shall not soon, ifever, be blessed with such a Constitution as those are intitled to, who have struggled hard for Freedom and Independence. You will permit uson this Occasion, just to hint to you our own Apprehension, that theremay be amongst us, some Persons disaffected to that great Cause for which we are contending, who may be secretly instructed by our common Enemy to divide and distract us; in hopes of preventing our Union inany Form of Government whatever, and by this Means of depriving usof the most honorable Testimony, as well as the greatest Security of our Freedom and Independence.--If there be such Men, it is our Wisdomto mark them, and guard ourselves against their Designs.WE may not expect to agree ina perfect System of Government: This1s not the Lot of Mankind. The great End of Government, is, to promotethe Supreme Good of human Society: Every social affection should thereore be interested in the Forming ofa Government and in judging ofonewhen it is Formed. Would it not be prudent for Individuals to castout of the Scale smaller considerations, and fall in with an evident MaIN framing a Constitution, to be adapted as far as possible to the Ca the cumstances of Posterity yet unborn, you will conceive it to be exceed ingly difficult, if not impracticable, to succeed in every part of it, to thefull Satisfaction of all. Could the whole Body of the People have Con vened for the same Purpose, there might have been equal Reason lo conclude, that a perfect Unanimity of Sentiments would have been an Object not to be obtained. In a Business so universally interesting we have endeavored to act as became the Representatives of a wise, undr standing and free People; and, as we have Reason to believe you wou yourselves have done, we have opened our Sentiments to each other wilf Candor, and made such mutual Concessions as we could consistently and without marring the only Plan, which in our most mature Judgmen we can at present offer to you. THE Interest of the Society is common to all its Members. The gre Enquiry is, wherein this Common Interest consists. In determining ths434jonty, unless in Matters in which their Consciences shall constrain themto determine otherwise? Such a Sacrifice, made for the sake of Union, would afford a strong Evidence of public Affection; and Union strengthened by the social Feeling, would promisea greater Stability to any Con- sitution, and, in its operation, a greater Degree of Happiness to the Society. It is here to be remembered, that on the Expiration of Fifteen Years a new Convention may be held, in order that such Amendmentsmay be made in the plan you may now agree to, as Experience, that best Instructor, shall then point out to be expedient or necessary.A GOVERNMENT without Power to exert itself, is at best, but an uselessPiece of Machinery. It is probable, that for the want of Energy, it would436 33. Convention Addressspeedily lose even the Appearance of Government, and sink into Апarchy. Unless a due Proportion of Weight is given to each of the Powersof Government, there will soon be a Confusion of the whole. An Overbearing of any one of its Parts on the rest, would destroy the Balance andaccelerate its Dissolution and Ruin: And, a Power without any Restraintis Tyranny. The Powers of Government must then be balanced: To dothis accurately requires the highest Skill in political Architecture. Thosewho are to be invested with the Administration, should have such Powersgiven to them, as are requisite to render them useful in their respectivePlaces; and such checks should be added to every Branch of Power asmay be sufficient to prevent its becoming formidable and injurious to theCommonwealth. If we have been so fortunate as to succeed in this pontof the greatest Importance, our Happiness will be complete, in the Prospect of having laid a good Foundation for many Generations. You атс arethe judges how far we have succeeded; and whether we have raised orSuperstructure, agreeably to our professed Design, upon the Principkesof a Free Commonwealth.IN order to assist your Judgments, we have thought it necessary, brieclyto explain to you the Grounds and Reasons upon which we have fornedour Plan. In the third article of the Declaration of Rights, we have, withas much Precision as we were capable of, provided for the free exercisof the Rights of Conscience: We are very sensible that our Constituentshold those Rights infinitely more valuable than all others; and we laterourselves, that while we have considered Morality and the Public Worship of GoD, as important to the happiness of Society, we have sufficientyguarded the rights of Conscience from every possible infringement. The Article underwent long debates, and took Time in proportion to its inportance; and we feel ourselves peculiarly happy in being able to iniormyou, that though the debates were managed by persons of various de nominations, it was. finally agreed upon with much more Unanimitythan usually takes place in disquisitions of this Nature. We wish you to consider the Subject with Candor, and Attention. Surely it would be an affront to the People of Massachusetts-Bay to labour to convince theт,that the Honor and Happiness ofa People depend upon Morality; andthat the Public Worship of GOD has a tendency to inculcate the Principsthereof, as well as to preserve a People from forsaking Civilization, andfalling into a state of Savage barbarity. March 1780 437IN the form now presented to you, there are no more Departments of Government than are absolutely necessary for the free and full Exerciseof the Powers thereof. The House of Representatives is intended as the Representative of the Persons, and the Senate of the property of the Cominonwealth. These are to be annually chosen and to sit in separate Bodies, each havinga Negative upon the Acts of [the] other. This Power ofa Negative in each must ever be necessary; for all Bodies of Men, assembled upon the same occasion and united by one common Interest ofRank, Honor, or Estate, are liable, like an individual, to mistake, bias and prejudice. These two Houses are vested with the Powers of Legisla- tion, and are to be chosen by the Male Inhabitants who are Twenty one Years of age, and have a Freehold of the small annual Income of Three Pounds, or Sixty Pounds in any Estate, Your Delegates considered that Persons who are Twenty one Years of age, and have no Property, are citier those who live upon a part of a Paternal estate, expecting the Fee thereof, who are but just entering into business, or those whose Idleness of Life and profigacy of manners will forever bar them from acquiring and possessing Property. And we will submit it to the former class, whether they would not think it safer for them to have their right of Voting for a Representative suspended for [a] small space of Time, than forever hereafter to have their Privileges liable to the control of Men, who will pay less regard to the Rights of Property because they have nothing toTHElose. Power of Revising, and stating objections to any Bill or Resolve that shall be passed by the two Houses, we were of opinion ought to be odged in the hands of some one person; not only to preserve the Laws from being unsystematical and inaccurate, but that a due balance may be preserved in the three capital powers of Government. The Legislative, the Judicial and Executive Powers naturally exist in every Government: And the History of the rise and fall of the Empires of the World affords us ample proof, that when the same Man or Body of Men enact, interpret and execute the Laws, property becomes too precarious to be valuable, and a People are finally borne down with the force of corruption result- ing from the Union of those Powers. The Governor is emphatically the Representative of the whole People, being chosen not by one Town or County, but by the People at large. We have therefore thought it safest/ to rest this Power in his hands; and as the Safety of the Commonwealth438 33. Convention Addressrequires, that there should be one Commander in Chief over the Militawe have given the Governor that Command for the same reason, that wethought him the only proper Person that could be trusted with the powerof revising the Bills and Resolves of the General Assembly; but the People may if they please choose their own Officers.beYou will observe that we have resolved, that Representation ought tofounded on the Principle of equality; but it cannot be understoodthereby that each Town in the Commonwealth shall have Weight andimportance in a just proportion to its Numbers and property. An exactRepresentation would be unpracticable even in a System of Governmentarising from the State of Nature, and much more so in a state alreadydivided into nearly three hundred Corporations. But we have agreedthat each Town having One hundred and fifty Rateable Polls shall beentitled to send one Member, and to prevent an advantage arising to thegreater towns by their numbers, have agreed that no Town shall sendtwo unless it hath three hundred and seventy-five Rateable Polls, andthen the still larger Towns are to send one Member for every two hundred and twenty-five Rateable Polls over and above Three hundred andseventy-five. This method of calculation will give a more exact Represeontation, when applied to all the Towns in the State, than any that wecould fix upon.cend March 1780 439to be Appointed by the Two Houses or either of them, the persons appointing them would be too numerous to be accountable for putting weak or wicked Men into Office. Besides the House is designed as the Grand Inquest of the Commonwealth, and are to impeach Officers for mal- conduct; the Senate are to try the Merits of such impeachments; it wouldbe therefore unfit that they should have the Creation of those Officers which the one may impeach and the other remove: but we conceivethere is the greatest propriety in Vesting the Governor with this Power,he being, as we have before observed, the complete representative of all the Pcople, and at all Times liable to be impeached by the House beforethe Senate for maladministration. And we would here observe that all the Powers which we have given the Governor are necessary to be lodged in the hands of one Man, as the General of the Army and first Magistrate, and none can be entitled to it but he who has the Annual and United Suffrages of the whole Commonwealth.You will readily conceive it to be necessary for your own Safety, that your Judges should hold their Offices during good behaviour; for Menwho hold their places upon so precariousa Tenure as annual or other frequent Appointments will never so assiduously apply themselves tostudy as will be necessary to the filling their places with dignity. Judges should at all Times feel themselves independent and free.We have however digressed from this rule in admitting the smalof Towns now incorporated to send Members. There are but a few othem which will not, from their continual increase, be able to send ondupon the above plan in a very little Time. And the few who will nеprobably have that number have been heretofore in the exercise of tliprivilege, and will now be very unwilling to relinquish it. YOUR Delegates have further provided that the Supreme Judicial De- partment, by fixed and ample Salaries, may be enabled to devote them- selveswholly to the Duties of their important Office. And for this reason,as well as to keep this Department separate from the others in Government, have excluded them from a Seat in the Legislature; and when our Constituents consider that the final Decision of their Lives and Propertymust be had in this Court, we conceive they will universally approve the measure. The Judges of Probate, and those other officers whose pres- To prevent the góvernor from abusing the Power which is necessarytobe put into his hands, we have provided that he shall have a Councl oadvise him at all Times and upon all important Occasions, and he withthe advice of his Council is to have the Appointment of Civil OficersThis was very readily agreed to by your Delegates, and will undoubiedybe agreeable to their Constituents; for if those Officers who are to intdpret and execute the Laws are to be dependent upon the Election of thepeople, it must forever keep them under the Control of ambitious, arteand interested men, who can obtain most Votes for them.-If they wertence is always necessary in their respective Counties, are also excluded.WE have attended to the inconveniencies suggested to have arisen fromhaving but one Judge of Probate in each County; but the erecting and altering Courts of Justice being a mere matter of Legislation, we havekeft it with your future Legislature to make such Alterations as the Circumstances of the several Counties may require.for440 33. Convention Address YoUR Delegates did not conceive themselves to be vested with Powerto set up one Denomination of Christians above another; for Religion must at all Times be a matter between GOD and individuals: But we have nevertheless, found ourselves obliged by a Solemn Test, to provide the exclusion of those from Offices who will not disclaim tho Principles of Spiritual Jurisdiction which Roman Catholicks in some Countries have held, and which are subversive of a free Government established by the People. We find it necessary to continue the formerLaws, and Modes of proceeding in Courts of Justice, until a futureLegislature shall alter them: For, unless this is done, the title to Estates will become precarious, Law-suits will be multiplied, and universal Con fusion must take place. And least the Commonwealth, for want ofa ducAdministration of Civil Justice, should be involved in Anarchy, we have proposed to continue the present Magistrates and Officers until new Ap pointments shall take place. THUs we have, with plainness and sincerity, given you the Reasons upon which we founded the principal parts of the System laid before youwhich appeared to us as most necessary to be-explained: And we do mos humbly beseech the Great Disposer of all Events, that we and ourterity may be established in, and long enjoy the Blessings of a ordered and free Government.PoswellIn the Name, and pursuant to a Resolution of the Convention, JAMES BOWDOIN, PresidentAttest. SAMUEL BARRETT, Secretary.34 The Constitution of 1780The Constitution of 1780 was a product not only of seven months of workby the convention, but also of years of agitation of the issues, of commonly held assumptions about the polity, of colonial precedent, and of immediate problems in the th use of power. The Constitution is reprinted from Journal of the Convention, 222-249.A CONSTITUTION OR FRAME OF GOVERNMENT, Agreedupon by the Delegates of the People of the STATE OF MASSACHU- SETTS-BAY,-In Convention,-Begun and held at Cambridge, on thePirst of September, 1779, and continued by Adjournments to the Secondof March, 1780.PREAMBLE.THE end of the institution, maintenance and administration of gov- ernment, is to secure the existence of the body-politic; to protect it; andto furnish the individuals who compose it, with the power of enjoying, in safety and tranquillity, their natural rights, and the blessings of life: And whenever these great objects are not obtained, the people have a night to alter the government, and to take measures necessary for their satcty, prosperity and happiness. THE body-politic is formed bya voluntary association of individuals:It is a social compact, by which the whole people covenants with eachotizen, and each citizen with the whole people, that all shall be governedby certain laws for the common good. It is the duty of the people, thereloe, fore in framinga Constitution of Government, to provide for an equitable node of making laws, as well as for an impartial interpretation, anda faithful execution of them; that every man may, at all times, find his security in them. WE, therefore, the people of Massachusetts, acknowledging, with grateful hearts, the goodness of the Great Legislator of the Universe, in affording us, in the course of His providence, an opportunity, deliberately and441442 34. Constitution of 1780agretpeaceably, without fraud, violence or surprise, of entering into an onginal, explicit, and solemn compact with each other; and of forming anew Constitution of Civil Government, for ourselves and posterity; anddevoutly imploring His direction in so interesting a design, Doupon, ordain and establish, the following Declaration of Rights,Frame of Government, as the CONSTITUTION Of the COMMONWEALTH OMASSACHUSETTS.PART THE FIRST.A Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.and ART. I.-ALL men are born free and equal, and have certain naturalessential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned theright of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acqur ing, possessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness.II.--Ir is the right as well as the duty of all men in society, publicly,and at stated seasons, to worship the SUPREME BEING, the great creatorand preserver of the universe. And no subject shall be hurt, molesicd.or restrained, in his person, liberty, or estate, for worshipping GOD in themanner and season most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscienсе;or for his religious profession or sentiments; provided he doth not disturb the public peace, or obstruct others in their religious worship.III.-As the happiness of a people, and the good order and preservation of civil government, essentially' depend upon piety, religion andmorality; and as these cannot be generally diffused through a community, but by the institution of the public worship of GOD, and of publicinstructions in piety, religion and morality: Therefore, to promote therhappiness and to secure ure the good order and preservation of their government, the people of this Commonwealth have a right to invest their legislature with power to authorize and require, and the legislature shallfrom time to time, authorize and require, the several towns, parishtsprecincts, and other bodies-politic, or religious societies, to make suitableprovision, at their own expense, for the institution of the public worship Constitution of 1780 443of GOD, and for the support and maintenance of public protestant teachers of piety, religion and morality, in all cases where such provision shallnot be made voluntarily.AND the people of this Commonwealth have also a right to, and do,invest their legislature with authority to enjoin upon all the subjects an attendance upon the instructions of the public teachers aforesaid, atstated times and seasons, if there be any on whose instructions they can conscientiously and conveniently attend. PROVIDED notwithstanding, that the several towns, parishes, precincts,and other bodies-politic, or religious societies, shall, at all times, have the exclusive right of electing their public teachers, and of contracting withthem for their support and maintenance.AND all monies paid by the subject to the support of public worship,and of the public teachers aforesaid, shall, if he require it, be uniformly applied to the support of the public teacher or teachers of his own religious sect or denomination, provided there be any on whose instrucdons he attends: otherwise it may be paid towards the support of the teacher or teachers ofthe parish or precinct in which the said monies are raised.AND every denomination of christians, demeaning themselves peace- ably, and as good subjects of the Commonwealth, shall be equally under the protection of the law: And no subordination of any one sect or denomination to another shall ever be established by law. IVTHE people of this Commonwealth have the sole and exclusiveright of governing themselves as a free, sovereign, and independent state;and do, and forever hereafter shall, exercise and enjoy every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not, or may not hereafter, be by them expressly delegated to the United States of America, in Congress as- sembled. V.-ALL power residing originally in the people, and being derived from them, the several magistrates and officers of government, vested with authority, whether legislative, executive, or judicial, are their sub- stitutes and agents, and are at all times accountable to them. VI.-No man, nor corporation, or association of men, have any other title to obtain advantages, or particular and exclusive privileges, distinct from those of the community, than what arises from the consideration444 34. Constitution of 1780of services rendered to the public; and this title being in nature neithe hereditary, nor transmissible to children, or descendants, or relationsb blood, the idea of a man born a magistrate, lawgiver, or judge, is absurd and unnatural. VII.--GOVERNMENT is instituted for the common good; for the protec tion, safety, prosperity and happiness of the people; and not for theprofit, honor, or private interest of any one man, family, or class of menTherefore the people alone have an incontestible, unalienable, and idefeasible right to institute government; and to reform, alter, or totallychange the same, when their protection, safety, prosperity and happinesrequire it. VIII.-IN order to prevent those, who are vested with authority, from becoming oppressors, the people have a right, at such periods and in such manner as they shall establish by their frame of government, to cause their public officers to return to private life; and to fill up vacantplaces by certain and regular elections and appointments.thisby IX.-ALL elections ought to be free; and all the inhabitants oft Commonwealth, having such qualifications as they shall establish their frame of government, have an equal right to elect officers, and to be elected, for public employments. X.-EACH individual of the society has a right to be protected by it in the enjoyment of his life, liberty and property, according to standinglaws. He is obliged, consequently, to contribute his share to the expensof this protection; to give his personal service, or an equivalent, when necessary: But no part of the property of any individual, can, withjustice, be taken from him, or applied to public uses without his own consent, or that of the representative body of the people: In fine, the people of this Commonwealth are not controlable by any other laws,than those to which their constitutional representative body have giveп their consent. And whenever the public exigencies require, that theproperty of any individual should be appropriated to public shall receivea reasonable compensation therefor. uses, heXI.-EVERY subject of the Commonwealth ought to find a certainremedy, by having recourse to the laws, for all injuries or wrongs whichhe may receive in his person, property, or character. He ought to obtain Constitution of 1780 445nght and justice freely, and without being obliged to purchase it; com- pletely, and without any denial; promptly, and without delay; con- lormably to the laws. XII-No subject shall be held to answer for any crime or offence,untul the same is fully and plainly, substantially and formally, describedto him; or be compelled to accuse, or furnish evidence against himself.And every subject shall have a right to produce all proofs, that may be favorable to him; to meet the witnesses against him face to face, and tobe fully heard in his defence by himself, or his council, at his election.And no subject shall be arrested, imprisoned, despoiled, or deprived of his property, immunities, or privileges, put out of the protection of thelaw, exiled, or deprived of his life, liberty, or estate; but by the judg- ment of his peers, or the law of the land.AND the legislature shall not make any law, that shall subject any person to a capital or infamous punishment, excepting for the governmentof the army and navy, without trial by jury. XIII.-IN criminal prosecutions, the verification of facts in the vicinity where they happen, is one of the greatest securities of the life, liberty, and property of the citizen. AIV-EVERY subject has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions. All warrants, therefore, are contrary to this right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by oath or alhrmation; and if the order in the warrant to a civil officer, to makesearch in suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons,or to seize their property, be not accompanied with a special designationof the persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure: and no warrant ought to be issued but in cases, and with the formalities, prescribed by the laws. XV.-IN all controversies concerning property, and in all suits betweenwo or more persons, except in cases in which it has heretofore been otherways used and practised, the parties have a right to a trial by jury;and this method of procedure shall be held sacred, unless, in causesarising on the high-seas, and such as relate to mariners wages, the kgislature shall hereafter find it necessary to alter it.446 34. Constitution of 1780XVI.-THE liberty of the press is essential to the security of freedomin a state: it ought not, therefore, to be restrained in this CommonwealthXVII.-THE people have a right to keep and to bear arms for tht common defence. And as in time of peace armies are dangerous to libery,they ought not to be maintained without the consent of the legislature;and the military power shall always be held in an exact subordinationto the civil authority, and be governed by it. XVIII.-A FREQUENT recurrence to the fundamental principles of theconstitution, and a constant adherence to those of piety, justice, moderation, temperance, industry, and frugality, are absolutely necessary topreserve the advantages of liberty, and to maintain a free governmentThe people ought, consequently, to have a particular attention to althose principles, in the choice of their officers and representatives: Andthey have a right to require of their law-givers and magistrates, an exactand constant observance of them, in the formation and execution of thelaws necessary for the good administration of the CommonwealthXIX.-ТHE people have a right, in an orderly and peaceable mannc,to assemble to consult upon the common good; give instructions to theựrepresentatives; and to request of the legislative body, by the way oaddresses, petitions, or remonstrances, redress of the wrongs done themand of the grievances they sufter.ХХ-ТнЕ рower of suspending the laws, or the execution of the lawought never to be exercised but by the legislature, or by authority derived from it, to be exercised in such particular cases only as the legislature shall expressly provide for.XXI.-THE freedom of deliberation, speech and debate, in either housof the legislature, is so essential to the rights of the people, that it cannotbe the foundation of any accusation or prosecution, action or complaint,in any other court or place whatsoever.XXII.-ТHE legislature ought frequently to assemble for the redresof grievances, for correcting, strengthening, and confirming the lawsand for making new laws, as the common good may require. Constitution of 1780 447 XXIII.--No subsidy, charge, tax, impost, or duties, ought to be established, fixed, laid, or levied, under any pretext whatsoever, without the consent of the people, or their representatives in the legislature. XXIV.-LAWs made to punish for actions done before the existence ofsuch laws, and which have not been declared crimes by preceding laws, are unjust, oppressive, and inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a free government. XXV.-No subject ought, in any case, or in any time, to be declared guilty of treason or felony by the legislature. XXVI.-No magistrate or court of law shall demand excessive bail or sureties, impose excessive fines, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. XXVII.-IN time of peace no soldier ought to be quartered in any house without the consent of the owner; and in time of war such quarters ought not to be made but by the civil magistrate, in a manner or- dained by the legislature. XXVIII.-No person can in any case be subjected to law-martial, or to any penalties or pains, by virtue of that law, except those employed in the army or navy, and except the militia in actual service, but by authority of the legislature. XXIX.-Iт is essential to the preservation of the rights of every indi- vidual, his life, liberty, property and character, that there be an impartial interpretation of the laws, and administration of justice. It is the rightof every citizen to be tried by judges as free, impartial and independentas the lot of humanity will admit.It is therefore not only the best policy, but for the security of the rights of the people, and of every citizen, that the judges of the supreme judicial court should hold their offices as longas they behave themselves well; and that they should have honorable salaries ascertained and established by standing laws. XXX.-IN the government of this Commonwealth, the legislative de- partment shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers, or eitherof them: The executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers, or either of them: The judicial shall never exercise the legislative448 34. Constitution of 1780and executive powers, or either of them: to the end it may be a govemment of laws and not of men.PART THE SECOND.The Frame of Government.THE people, inhabiting the territory formerly called the Province aMassachusetts-Bay, do hereby solemnly and mutually agree with eachother, to form themselves into a free, sovereign, and independent body politic or state, by the name of THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS.CHAPTER І.The Legislative Power.SECTION 1.
