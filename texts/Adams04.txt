The Roman republic, according to its custom of placing judges in all places underits dominion, fent to Piftoia a pretor who hadthe whole jurifdiction, civil and criminal, over thecity; referving always, according to the tenor ofthe Roman laws, the obedience to the magiſtratesof that commonwealth. This jurifdiction, acquired by the Roman Republic over the city of Piftoia, paffed to the Roman emperors, and fromthefe into the power of the Goths and the Lombards, and fuccefively in thofe who, from time totime, were the Lords (fignore) of Tufcany; andhas continued, down to our times, under the fametie and obligation of dependence. It was contended, that to fay" that laws do or can govern, is to amuſe our-" felves with a form of fpeech, as when we fay"time, or age, or death, does fuch a thing.That the government is not in the law, but inthe perfon whofe will gives a being to that law."That the perfection of monarchy confifts in governing by a nobility, weighty enough to keep"the people under, yet not tall enough, in anyparticular perfon, to meafure with the prince;and by a moderate army, kept up under thenotion of guards and garrifons, which may befufficient to ftrangle all feditions in the cradle;" by councils, not fuch as are co-ordinate with" the prince, but purely of advice and difpatch," with power only to perfuade, not limit, the" prince's will*." In fuch a fituation, writers onthe fide of liberty thought themfelves obliged toconfider what was then practicable, not abſtractedly what was the beſt : they felt the neceffity ofleaving the monarchical and ariſtocratical ordersout of their fchemes of government, becaufe allthe friends of thofe orders were their enemies, andof addrefling themfelves wholly to the democratical party, becaufe they alone were their friends;at leaſt there appears no other hypothefis onwhich to acconnt for the crude conceptions ofMilton and Nedham. The latter, in his preface,difcovers his apprehenfions and feelings, too clearly to be miſtaken, in thefe words : "I be-" lieve none will be offended with this following" difcourſe, but thofe that are enemies to public" welfare : let ſuch be offended ftill; it is not for" their fakes that I publiſh this enfuing treatife,* Sce the political pamphlets of that day, written on thefide of monarchy."but"but for your fakes that have been noble patriots,"fellow-foldiers and sufferers for the liberties and" freedoms of your country." As Mr. Turgot'sidea of a commonwealth, in which all authorityis to be collected into one centre, and thatcentre the nation, is fuppofed to be precifely theproject of Marchamont Nedham, and probablyderived from his book, and as "The Exçellency of" a free State" is a valuable morfel of antiquity wellknown in America, where it has many partifans,it may be worth while to examine it, efpecially asit contains every femblance of argument whichcan poffibly be urged in favour of the fyftem, as itis not only the popular idea of a republic both inFrance and England, but is generally intended bythe words republic, commonwealth, and popular ftate,when ufed by Engliſh writers, even thofe of themoſt fenſe, taſte, and learning. Marchamont Nedham lays it down as a fundamental principle, and an undeniable rule, " thatthe people, that is, fuch as ſhali be fuccefſfivelychofen to reprefent the people, are the beft"keepers of their own liberties, and that for" many reafons: Firft, becaufe they never think" of ufurping over other men's rights, but mind" which way to preferve their own."Our firft attention ſhould be turned to the propofition itfelf, "The people are the beft keepers"of their own liberties." But who are the people? " Such as ſhall be fucceffively chofen to re-"prefent them."-Here is a confufion both ofwords and ideas, which, though it may pafs withthe generality of readers in a fugitive pamphlet,or with a majority of auditors in a popular harangue, ought, for that very reafon, to be ascarefully avoided in politics as it is in philofophyor mathematics. If by the people is meant thewholein government, or fit at the helm, but ſuch asfhall be judged fit, and chofen by the people;3. That the people are the only proper judges ofthe convenience or inconvenience of a government when it is erected, and of the behaviour ofgovernors after they are chofen.-But then it is infiſted, that rational and regular means ſhall beufed that the whole people may be their owncarvers, that they may judge and choofe whoſhall preſide, and that they may determine on theconvenience or inconvenience of government, andthe behaviour of governors. But then it is in- fiſted, that the town of Berwick upon Tweedfhall not carve, judge, chooſe, and determine forthe whole kingdom of Great Britain, nor thecounty of Berkſhire for the Maffachufetts; muchlefs that a lawlefs tyrannical rabble ſhall do allthis for the ſtate, or even for the county of Berkfhire.It may be, and is admitted, that a free government is moſt natural, and only fuitable to thereafon of mankind; but it by no means follows"that the other forms, as a ſtanding power in the"hands of a particular perfon, as a king, or of"a fet number of great ones, as in a fenate," muchlefs that a mixture of the three fimple forms"are befide the dictates of nature, and mere" artificial devices of great men, ſquared only to" ferve the ends and intereſts of avarice, pride," and ambition of a few, to a vaffallizing of the" community."-If the original and fountai. ofall power and government is in the people, as undoubtedly it is, the people have as clear a right:o erect a fimple monarchy, ariſtocracy, or democracy, or an equal mixture, or any other mixtureof all three, if they judge it for their liberty,happiness, and profperity, as they have to erect ademocracy;democracy; and infinitely greater and better menthan Marchamiont Nedham, and the wifeſt nationsthat ever lived, have preferred fuch mixtures, andeven with fuch ſtanding powers, as ingredients intheir compofitions. But even thofe nations whochoofe to referve in their own hands the periodical choice of the firſt magiſtrate, fenafe, and affembly, at certain ſtated periods, have as clear aright to appoint a firſt magiſtrate for life as foryears, and for perpe.uity in his defcendants asfor life. When I fay for perpetuity, or for life,it is always meant to imply, that the fame peoplehave at all times a right to interpofe, and to depofe for mal-adminiſtration-to appoint anew.No appointment of a king or fenate, or any ftanding power, can be, in the nature of things, for alonger period than quam diu fe bene gefferit, thewhole nation being judge. An appointment forlife, or perpetuity, can be no more than an appointment until further order; but further ordercan only be given by the nation: and until thenation íhall have given the order, an eftate forlife, or in fee, is held in the office. It muſt bea great occafion which can induce a nation totake fuch a fubject into confideration and make achange. Until a change is made, an hereditarylimited monarch is the reprefentative of the wholenation, for the management of the executivepower, as much as an houfe of reprefentatives is,as one branch of the legiflature, and as guardianof the public purſe; and a houfe of lords too, ora ſtanding ſenate, reprefents the nation for otherpurpofes, viz. as a watch fet upon both the reprefentatives and the executive power. The people are the fountain and original of the power ofkings and lords, governors and fenates, as wellas the houfe of commons, or affembly of reprefentatives:fentatives: and if the people are fufficiently enlightened to fee all the dangers that furroundthem, they will always be reprefented by a diſtinctperfonage to manage the whole executive power;-a diftinet fenate, to be guardians of propertyagainft levellers for the purpofes of plunder, tobe a repoſitory of the national tradition of publicmaxims, cutoms, and manners, and to be controulers in turn both of kings and their miniſterson one fide, and the reprefentatives of the peopleon the other, when either difcover a difpofition todo wrong;-and a diſtinct houfe of reprefentatives,to be the guardians of the public purfe, and toprotect the people in their turn againft both kingsand nobles. A ſcience certainly comprehends allthe principles in nature which belong to the fubject. The principles in nature which relate togovernment cannot all be known, without a knowledge of the hiftory of mankind. The Engliſhconftitution is the only one which has conſideredand provided for all caſes that are known to havegenerally, indeed to have always happened in the progrefs of every nation; it is, therefore, the onlyfcientifical government. To fay then that ſtanding powers have been erected, as mere artificialdevices of great men, to ferve the ends of avarice,pride, and ambition of a few, to the vaffallizing ofthe community, is to declain and abuſe. Standing powers have been inſtituted to avoid greaterevils, corruption, fedition, war, and bloodſhed, inelections; it is the people's bufineſs, therefore, tofind out fome method of avoiding them, withoutſtanding powers. The Americans flatter themfelves they have hit upon it: and no doubt theyave for a time, perhaps a long one : but thisremains to be proved by experience.
