AN accurate and critical knowledge of Law  is indeed a necessary qualification for those persons who undertake to deliver their opinions concerning the nicer and more difficult questions of jurisprudence; but, when the Natural Rights of any of our fellow-subjects are apparently at stake, every man has a right to judge for himself, and to declare his sentiments, as far as plain conclusions of reason and common-sense will fairly warrant; and such only are referred to in the following Declaration of the Natural Right of popular Representation in the legislature.Amongst all the rights and privileges appertaining unto us, .that of having a Share in the Legislation, and being to be governed by such laws as we ourselves shall chuse, is the most fundamental and essential, as well as the most advantageous and beneficial, &c.And as all British subjects, whether in Great-Britain, Ireland, or the Colonies, are equally free by the law of Nature, they certainly are equally entitled to the same Natural Rights that are essential for their own preservation; because this privilege of having a share in the legislation is not merely a British Right, peculiar to this island, but it is also a Natural Right, which cannot, without the most flagrant and stimulating injustice, be withdrawn from any part of the British Empire by any worldly authority whatsoever; because,by the natural Law, whereunto he [ALMIGHTY GOD] hath made all subject, the lawful power of making laws, to command whole politic societies of men, belongeth so properly unto the same entire societies, that for any Prince or Potentate, of what kind soever upon earth, to exercise the same of himself,[or themselves,] and not either by express Commission immediately and personally received from God, or else by authority derived at the first from their consent upon whose persons they impose laws, it is no better than mere tyranny! Laws they are not, therefore, which public Approbation hath not made so.Agreeable to the same just principles of natural Equity is that maxim of the English Constitution, thatLaw, to bind all, must be assented to by all;and there can be no legal appearance of Assent without some degree of Representation.It must indeed be acknowledged, that the Representation of the people of England is not so perfect as equity may seem to require, since very many individuals have no VOTE in Elections, and consequently cannot be said expressly to give their Assent to the laws by which they are governed: nevertheless, the whole country which they inhabit, and in which they earn their bread, and even the very houses in which they live,  with the following reflection:That, in a government such as that of England, all the efforts that the Sovereign makes, to usurp an absolute authority, are so many steps which lead him towards the precipice. It is manifest, therefore, that the constitutional government of England, even with all its defects, is infinitely better than any other form of government whereby the people are deprived of their just share in the legislature; so that the Inequality of Representation in this island affords no just argument for setting aside the Representation of the people in other parts of the British Empire; because experience teaches us, that even a defective Representation is better than none at all; and therefore it is highly unreasonable, and contrary to natural Equity, to pretend that our brethren and fellow-subjects in the more distant parts of the British Empire ought to be deprived entirely of their natural Rights and Liberties, merely because our own liberties are not entirely perfect! or because our own Representation in the Legislature appears, in some few respects, to be defective! and it would be quite as unreasonable to alledge, that the principle or reason of the maxim before quoted that Freemen should not have the free disposal of their own effects;— and whatever is iniquitous can never be made lawful by any authority on earth; not even by the united authority of King, Lords, and Commons; for that would be contrary to the eternalLaws of God, which are supreme.In every point of view, the making laws for the subjects of any part of the British Empire, without their participation and assent, is INIQUITOUS, and therefore unlawful: for though the purport of any law, so made, be in itself perfectly just and equitable, yet it becomes otherwise  by the want of these necessary legal Formalities of Representation and Assent: for if the inhabitants of one part of the empire might determine a question, or enact a law, for the peculiar advantage only of that one part, though to the manifest detriment and injury of another part, without the Representation of the latter, the former part would be made judges in their own cause; a circumstance that would be literally partial! the very reverse of justice and natural equity, and which must, therefore, be esteemed Iniquity, even to a fundamental maxim,viz.It is INIQUITOUS for any one to be a Judge in his own cause. Partiality is, therefore, such an abomination in the eye of the law, that no Power on earth can make it LAWFUL: for even an Act of Parliament “is VOID in itself;” forjura naturae sunt immutabilia,and they are “leges legum.”Every King of England  is restrained by the Law from changing or making new Laws without the assent or consent of his WHOLE KINGDOM in Parliament expressed.And the whole Kingdom, even of Great-Britain itself, is only a part of the British Empire; and therefore, by a parity of reasoning, cannot justly or equitably be permitted to make laws for the whole; becausewhere the same reason is, the same law  must prevail: forturpis est pars quae non convenit cum suo toto;andnihil in lege intolerabilius est, eandem rem diverso jure censeri.4 Co. 83.The free Representation of the people in the legislature is, therefore, to be esteemed, of all our Rights, the most essential,  to maintain that excellent Equilibrium of power, or mixt government, limited by law, which our ancestors have always most zealously asserted, and transmitted to us, as our best Birthright and Inheritance; so that every attempt to set the same aside in any degree, or in any part of the empire, or to corrupt it by undue influence of places and pensions, or bribes with public money, is Treason against the Constitution; the highest of Treason: and therefore whatsoever is ordained, that can clearly be proved to be contrary to the constitution, must be allowed to be fundamentally wrong, and therefore null and void of itself; for,sublato fundamento, cadit opus. But more particularly the Parliament has no power to give up the ancient and established Right of the people to be represented in the legislature; because an Act for so base a purpose would entirely subvert the principles and constitution on which the very Existence of the legislature itself, which ordained it, is formed! so that such an unnatural Act of the state would be parallel to the crime of felo de se in a private person; and, being thus contrary tothe nature of things, can never be rendered valid by any Authority whatsoever. And indeed it is laid down as a maxim, by the great Lord Sommers, that no man or society of men have power to deliver up their preservation, or the means of it, to the absolute Will of any man ; and they will have always a right to preserve what they have not power to part with.And if a politic society has no just power to deliver up even its own preservation, it certainly has much less right to deliver up the necessary preservation of other societies of their brethren and friends  without their Consent: and all such attempts must necessarily be deemed void and ineffectual, becausethere is no necessity to obey, where there is no authority to ordain. For as it so clearly appears, from what has been said, that Natural Equity does not permit even the inferior Property of lands, goods, chattels, or money, to be alienated without the consent or fault of the proprietors, much less can it permit the alienation, annulling, or changing, of our most valuable inheritance, the Law, without the due assent and consent of the heritors themselves, the People at large, or their lawful Representatives in their respective assemblies or parliaments! This is a necessary conclusion of reason and common-sense; drawn from the effect and force of Natural Equity, even in cases of much less consequence  as their situation upon the face of the globe is distant; that is, as widely different as the East is from the West! Would this be equitable? could such notorious Injusticebe ever made lawful? The true constitutional mode of connecting British Dominions, that are otherwise separated by Nature, is demonstrated by the established example of the Union of Great-Britain and Ireland, which by long experience has proved to be sufficiently effectual. It must be acknowledged, indeed, that an Act of Parliament was made in the 6th of K. George I. chap. 5. wherein it is laid down, thatthe King and Parliament of Great-Britain may make Laws to bind Ireland.But, as it does not appear that the Parliament of Ireland ever acknowledged or gave any formal Assent to the said Act, the same must necessarily be considered as a mere assertion on one part, at the making of which, the persons most materially concerned on the other part were neither HEARD, nor represented! a defect the most notorious that can possibly be attributed to any proceeding, either in the enacting or execution of Laws! and therefore it is to very little purpose to cite the said Act as a Precedent for taxing the American Subjects without their Consent; for the privileges which the Parliament of Ireland has maintained and enjoyed, both before and since that time,  they are nevertheless firmly united by the circle of the British Diadem, so as to form one vast Empire, which will never be divided, if the safe and honest policy be adopted, of maintaining the British Constitution inviolate, in all parts of the Empire: for it is a system so natural, so beneficial, and so engaging, to the generality of mankind, that by the same means we might hold the Empire of the World, were the laws of natural Equity, Justice, and Liberty, to be strictly observed, and the abomination of domestic as well as political Slavery abolished!On the other hand, it is not only Treason against the Constitution to attempt to deprive any free British Subjects of their natural Right to a Share in the Legislature, but it is equally derogatory and injurious to the Authority of the Crown; because a King of England has no legal Authority to govern by any other mode than that limited government called the English Constitution, which he is sworn to maintain; for such is the frailty of human nature, that no man or body of men whatever is to be entrusted with the administration of government, unless they are thus limited by Law, and by a due Representation of the people at large, subject to a frequent appeal, by Election, to the whole body of constituents: for it is a maxim,that he who is allowed more Power, by Law, than is fit,  the same will still desire more Power than is already lawful: so that no Power on earth is tolerable without a just limitation; and Law, which ought to be supreme,cannot subsist where Will and Pleasure are absolute, whether it be the Will of one, of a few, or of many.A King, therefore, who presumes to act without the constitutional limitation, destroys the foundation of his own authority; for the most respectable and most ancient writer on the English Constitution assures us, thatthere is no King where Will rules, “and not Law.“ The same doctrine is expressed still more clearly in the old Year Books, that, if there was no Law, there would be no King, and no inheritance.For these plain reasons, whenever the English Government ceases to be limited, in any part of the British Dominions, it ceases to be lawful!And therefore the fatal consequences of proceeding to enforce the execution of any Acts, or Resolutions, for the establishing such unlimited and unlawful Government, is more easily conceived than expressed; becausethe condition of all subjects would be alike, whether under absolute or limited Government, if it were not lawful to maintain and preserve those limitations, since Will and Pleasure, and not Law, would be, alike in both, the measure of obedience; for, to have liberties and privileges, unless they may be defended, and to have none at all, is the same thing as to be governed by mere Will and Pleasure ; and misera est servitus ubi jus est vagum aut incertum.
