Honourable gentlemen of the legislative-council,Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen of the general assembly,Your presenting a bill which I am under the absolute necessity of rejecting, gives me infinite concern, as I have very great deference for your opinion. But I should betray the important trust reposed in me, and be utterly unworthy of the publick confidence, if any consideration could induce me to submit my own judgment upon this occasion to that of others however respectable.Having thoroughly revolved the matter, I think myself bound to refuse assent to this bill; and, being responsible for the faithful discharge of my duty, to declare the reasons for such refusal.I have taken an oath to preside over the people of this state, according to the constitution or form of government agreed to and resolved upon by the representatives of South-Carolina in March 1776; it is therefore impossible for me, without breach of this solemn obligation, to give my sanction to the establishment of a different mode of government. But if I were not restrained by an oath, I should nevertheless put a negative on the bill, because it annihilates one branch of the legislature, and transfers the right of electing another branch from the general assembly to the people; and nothing is clearer to me than that we have not lawful power so to do. For, on the late dissolution of government, the people, being at liberty to choose what form they pleased, agreed to one vesting an authority for making the laws by which they were to be bound in three branches, and committed it to the care of the several branches, not to be violated or infringed, but to be preserved as a sacred deposit, as the security of their lives, liberties and properties, which, after mature deliberation, they deemed it wisest to provide.The legislative authority, being fixed and limited, cannot change or destroy itself without subverting the constitution from which it is derived. The people by that delegated to us a power of making laws, not of creating legislators; and there can be no doubt that we have authority to take the right of electing a legislative-council from that body in which the constitution placed it, and give it to another, we may not only do the like with the mode of electing members of assembly, and a president, but vest the election of both the assembly and council in any other body instead of the people, and the election of a president in some other body than the council and assembly; and that if we have power to lop one branch of the legislature, we may cut off either of the other branches, and suffer the legislative authority to be exercised by the remaining branch only, or abolish the third also, and invest the whole authority in some other person or body. Nor is it chimerical to suppose that such infractions may be attempted by others, since violations similar to these have been committed.We know that one of the houses of parliament voted the other house useless and dangerous, and that it ought to be abolished—That publick bodies, elected and eligible by the people, have wrested the right of election from their constituents, filling up vacancies, which the deaths of members occasioned, by their own choice—That an English parliament enacted a law empowering the King, for the time being, with advice of the major part of his council, to set forth proclamations under such pains and penalties as to him and them should seem necessary, and declaring that those proclamations should be observed as though they were made by act of parliament—That offenders against them should be liable to the forfeitures and imprisonments therein expressed, and adjudged traitors if they should quit the realm to avoid answering their offence—That a British triennial parliament constituted itself, and succeeding parliaments septennial; and though frequent elections are evidently for the benefit of the people, they have strove in vain for upwards of half a century to abridge the time of their parliament’s duration.In short, we know that freedom is totally extinct in many nations whose greatest glory it was for ages, by the people's having surrendered every privilege, and become slaves to despotism. Experience therefore teaches that it is the indispensible duty of every lover of his country to adhere inflexibly to its constitution, not admitting any innovation of it, though specious and plausible, lest the first making way for others, they rush forward like an impetuous torrent, bearing down all before it.Supposing, however, that we had power to form a new constitution, I apprehend that the causes assigned for it are altogether insufficient. The bill recites, “that the present was temporary only, and suited to the situation of publick affairs when it was resolved on, looking forward to an accommodation with Great-Britain, an event then desired. But that the United Colonies have since been constituted independent states by the declaration of the honourable continental Congress, and it is therefore become absolutely necessary to frame a constitution suited to that great event.”Admitting our form of government to be temporary, it is to continue until that accommodation shall take place, until peace between Great-Britain and America shall be concluded, though I do not hold that it must then be altered, and think it should not, unless a better can be devised. We still look forward to such accommodation, an event as desirable now as it ever was, so that the situation of publick affairs is in this respect the same as when the constitution was established; and though indeed, since the declaration of independence, the style of this country is somewhat altered, having been heretofore one of the United Colonies, and being now one of the United States of America; yet it exercised, and constitutionally, the same supreme power before as it has since that period.Such declaration therefore cannot make it necessary to change the form of government, nor can I conceive any reason which does. The good of the people being the end of government, that is the best form under which they are happiest; they being the fittest judges of what would be most productive of their happiness, preferred the present mode of electing a legislative-council to that which is offered for electing a senate; probably because it appeared more likely that persons of the greatest integrity, learning and abilities would be chosen by and from among their representatives when assembled, than by electors in their several parishes and districts; and it may have seemed incongruous, that there should be two representative bodies, the less controlling the greater.The people also preferred a compounded or mixed government to a simple democracy, or one verging towards it, perhaps because, however unexceptionable democratic power may appear at the first view, its effects have been found arbitrary, severe and destructive. Certain it is that systems which in theory have been much admired, on trial have not succeeded; and that projects and experiments relative to government are of all schemes the most dangerous and fatal.The people having adopted such a constitution as seemed to them the most perfect, when it is not even surmised that any grievance or inconvenience has arisen from it, and when they are satisfied with and happy under it (which I firmly believe they are), if we had authority I should conceive it neither politic, expedient or justifiable to change this form for another, especially as I think that the one proposed will not be better than, or so good as, what we now enjoy; and whether it would or not, is a speculative point which time only can determine.Thus I have shewn that it is not in my power to agree to this bill, and why, if it were, I should not.I am not so vain as to imagine that what I have said can influence your minds in a matter which has been so lately the subject of debate. But having delivered my sincere and real sentiments (with a freedom which I hope is neither unbecoming nor offensive) I confide in your candour to regard them as such. And now I think proper to resign the office of president and commander in chief of this state. I do accordingly resign it into your hands, and request that you will accept this resignation, and elect some person to it in my stead.
