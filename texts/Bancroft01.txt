The Right Honourable George Grenville succeeded to the Treasury, on its Abdication by Lord Bute; and eager to display the Abilities of a Financier, undertook to provide new Resources for national and ministerial Exigencies, by Commercial Regulations; an extension of Excise in Great-Britain; and a Tax on the Colonies. An unprecedented Naval Establishment was formed to aid in Collection of the Customs; the Vigour of Commerce was depressed, and a most valuable Branch of Trade exterminated in America: The odious Cyder and Stamp Acts also received Existence, and were received with universal Opposition; whilst their common Parent, from another Cause, was happily divested of every public Employment. Incessant have been his Endeavours, and various his Expedients, since that Æra, for the Recovery of Power; among which that of writing himself into Office is not the least considerable. The Public has seen his ministerial Conduct and Capacity applauded without Modesty or Truth, not only in Prose, but Verse * , not only in the Daily Papers, but in Volumes, written either by himself or Dependants, for no other Purpose. The most considerable of these Performances are, The Present State of the Nation, and The Controversy between Great Britain and her Colonies reviewed, both apparently written by the same Persons. In the former, the Authors endeavour to convey an Eulogium on Mr. Grenville’s political Conduct; present an exaggerated Idea of those Miseries in which the Nation is involved by the preposterous Measures of the present Ministry; and by suggesting the Necessity of a Change, to make Way for their Patron’s Return to his pristine Power. The latter has been written more especially to obviate the many Objections which have been justly made to Mr. Grenville’s Return to Office, on Account of the Difficulties in which the Nation has been already involved by his American Measures. Though both these Performances have ultimately the same End in View, they have been very differently received by the Ministry. The former was naturally condemned; but the latter, conveying no direct Censure on the present Administration, and aiming only to justify Mr. Grenville’s former Conduct, by vindicating that national Supremacy over the Colonies, which those in Power have somewhat intemperately supported, has received the concurrent Support of Ministerial, and Grenvillian Approbation. It is this Performance that is the Subject of my present Observations. A Performance undertaken with many Advantages, and executed with laboured Fallacy, Art, and Sophistry, for the laudable Purpose of encouraging the People of Great Britain to oppress their American Brethren; and of persuading the Inhabitants of the Colonies, in Opposition to the Feelings of Nature, and the Dictates of Common Sense, to relinquish those Rights, which alone constitute the Distinctions between Freedom and Slavery.—To oppose a Design so malevolent is the Duty of every Individual, but more especially of every uncorrupt British American, not yet converted to a Patricide by a lucrative Office, or ministerial Dependance.— “On this Principle, and actuated by these Motives, it is, that, unawed by the Terrors that rise before me, I adventure upon my present undertaking, and set down to expose The Review of the American Controversy, with the single, and, I hope, honest Purpose,” of vindicating the Right of my Fellow Subjects in that Country in which I received my Being, and of exposing the Fallacy of those Arguments which have been urged against them by the Author, or rather Authors, of the Work before me.—I cannot, indeed, investigate the Nature of those Terrors which these Gentlemen foresaw, as attendant on their Attempt to vindicate that national Sovereignty over the Colonies, which a British Parliament has solemnly asserted (Terrors of which they have expressed lively and affecting Ideas, in the Words I have just recited,) as Reason seems to suggest more Danger in an Undertaking, in some Degree repugnant to the Sovereignty thus asserted. I flatter myself, however, that, as the Colonies are denied every Species of Representation in the British Legislature, I may be allowed, in this Manner, to expose the Grievance attending the present Exercise of Parliamentary Authority over them, who have no better Method of Justification; provided it be done with that Decency, Moderation, and Justice, which I hope will characterize my present Observations. The Pleas urged by the Advocates for the Colonies, our Authors have reduced to the two following general Heads: “The Title of the Inhabitants in the Colonies to all the Rights, Liberties and Privileges of Englishmen; and their Claim to Exemption from the Jurisdiction of Parliament.” But the latter of these Claims, of Exemption from the Jurisdiction of Parliament, was never exhibited by any Advocate for the Colonies, and is a perfect Non-entity, which our Authors have imposed on the Publick, to obtain an Opportunity of combatting Errors of their own Creation, and of sagaciously demonstrating the obvious Absurdity of claiming the Privileges of British Subjects, and at the same Time denying the Jurisdiction of the British Legislature.—The Colonies do not deny the Authority of Parliament in any Particular, except that of arbitrarily taking away their Property, actually acquired through all the Restraints which Parliament has opposed to the Acquisition. Had they therefore, imputed to the Colonies a Claim of Exemption from the Taxation, instead of “Jurisdiction” of Parliament, they would have acted with more Justice. Having thus erroneously stated the Claims of the Colonies, our Author (for I shall here after mention them in the Singular Number, as they mention themselves,) proceeds to shew the Danger they must incur from Prerogative, should they succeed in vindicating their imputed Claim of Exemption from Parliamentary Authority, without first proving their Title to the Rights, Liberties, and Privileges of Englishmen: To determine the Justice of this Title in the Colonies, he examines the Resolves of their several Assemblies, subsequent to the late Stamp Act, and in the Course of his Examination rejects every Fact alledged by them in Support of their Claim to the Rights and Privileges of Englishmen. The Law of God and Nature, the natural Rights of Mankind, a Royal Charter, an Act of Parliament, common Justice, &c. are all with him of no Avail; and he exults in the flattering Idea, of having proved the Contents of the American Resolves to be inconsistent and absurd. It is not my Intention to enter into a particular Vindication of the Resolutions of these Assemblies; it will be sufficient for me to observe, that the Absurdity he has imputed to them, is wholly imaginary, and arises solely from his having imposed on them a Claim of Exemption from Parliamentary Jurisdiction, which they never exhibited. I could wish, however, that our Author had explained the Principles on which the British Nation founds its Title to the Constitution it now enjoys; since he has rejected those alledged by the American Assemblies. I do not mean the Title of an Englishman to the Privileges of an English Subject, but of the Nation collectively to its Constitution.—I am sufficiently aware of the Impropriety of claiming the Rights belonging to the Members of a State, without yielding Obedience to its Legislative Authority; but will venture, notwithstanding, to affirm, that if the Colonies should be found without the Jurisdiction of the British Parliament, their Title to Rights and Privileges, similar to those of British Subjects, is founded on Principles as valid, and just, as those which support the Right of the British Nation to its present Constitution. The first Settlers in the American Colonies, at the Time of their Migration, be sides their natural Right to Freedom, were constitutionally intitled to all the Rights, Privileges, and Immunities of Englishmen; and the Security and Perpetuation of these, or similar Privileges, was, in forming the Constitution of the Colonies, expresly stipulated, between the King and People, and confirmed by the Faith of Royal Charters; fundamental, and consequently indefeasible Acts, equally binding on the Prince and Subjects; and I will venture to assert, that neither Great Britain, nor any other Nation, has a better Title to its Constitution, than that of the Colonies. Whether the Clauses in their Charters, which expresly convey to their Inhabitants, and their “Children and Posterity which shall be born there, all the Privileges, Liberties, Franchises, and Immunities of free Denizens, and natural Subjects, within any of his Majesty’s Dominions to all Intents and Purposes, as if they had been abiding and born within his Realm of England, &c.” was intended to secure them the Enjoyment of these Privileges in Quality of English Subjects, or only to confirm to them Privileges similar to those of English Subjects, is of little Importance: Our Author, indeed, denies the Right of the King to grant Foreigners the Privileges of natural Subjects; but he will not deny the King’s Right to grant the Inhabitants of the Colonies without the Realm, Privileges perfectly similar to those of Englishmen; and these will satisfy us in America, as well as the very identical ones; and whenever we chuse to return within the Realm, if our Royal Charters cannot render us Englishmen, perhaps it may be expedient to avail ourselves of the Act of the 13th of George the Second, which is abundantly sufficient for that Purpose. Our Author has, indeed, objected to this, as inconsistent, in the Assembly of the Massachusetts; but let him not object it to me as such. Ludicrous as he may think it, I assert, that Parliament may have a “Right to benefit, but not bind, a State, and to give Bounties, but not impose Buerthens.” It may give the People of Holland, who live within the Realm, the Privileges of natural Subjects, but not tax them when in their own Country. The Rights of the Colonies being thus secured, whether within or without the Realm, all those alarming Apprehensions of Danger from our falling into the Hands of Prerogative, which our Author, and some others equally notorious for their Affection to the Colonies, and sollicitous for the Preservation of their Rights, profess to entertain, and good naturedly, though somewhat officiously, disclose, appear to have no just Foundation. A King inclined to Despotism might, indeed, invade the Rights of the Colonies, in Spite of those Compacts and Charters, by which they have been solemnly confirmed: But the same King might, with equal Justice and Facility, infringe the Conditions of the Great Charter of English Liberty; and from the Corruption which at present universally prevails in this Kingdom, I doubt not but it might be effected with more Impunity than in the Colonies; so that if they should ever be deemed distinct States, I doubt not but their Liberties would be at least as secure from the Encorachments of Prerogative, as those of Great Britain. The next Subject of our Author’s Enquiry is, Whether the Colonies ought to be considered as distinct independent States, or mere British Corporations, within the Realm and Jurisdiction of Parliament: And in several Parts of his Review, he endeavours to support the latter. Conclusions, though by very delusive Arguments and unfair Representations, Shall I controvert this Conclusion, and expose the Fallacy on which it is founded; or shall I tacitly assent thereto?—The Colonies do not declare themselves distinct States, independent to the British Parliament; nor do I really know whether they would chuse to be considered as such. The present Ministry, indeed, appear sollicitous to have them deemed as Parts of the Realm, and already adequately and constitutionally represented in its Legislative Assembly, in which not one Member is elected by, or dependent on them. But as this, if admitted, must reduce them to a State of Slavery, as positive and abject as any that ever was imposed on any People, and as I cannot so far divest myself of Patriotism as to be unconcerned for the Fate of my native Country; I shall endeavour to expose the Fallacy of this ministerial Position, so injurious to the Colonies, by fairly explaining the Terms, Principles, and Designs of their Settlement; and the Degree and Mode of Connection, which was intended, and ought to subsist, between them and their Parent Country. To effect this, it will be necessary to review their Political History, the Charters on which they were settled, the Circumstances attending their Settlement, and the Conduct of the King and Parliament towards them since that Æra; which will afford an Opportunity of exposing the Fallacy and Partiality of our Author’s Extracts from the Charters of the several Colonies, and the Acts of Parliament relating to them.—As the original Constitution of the Colonies, and their Connection with this Kingdom, is of Importance in determining the present Controversy, and as our Author has treated it in various Forms, and in different Parts of his Work, I shall beg Leave to refute his Arguments, under one general Head, without regarding the Order (if it may be so called) in which he has disposed them. “The first Charter granted by the Crown of England for the Purpose of Colonization, is not that granted by King James the First, to the two Virginia Companies, dated April the 10th, 1606, as our Author asserts, those which precede it not having been granted for the Purpose of Discovery” only, but of Colonization also; the first Patent ever granted by the English Crown for planting Colonies, being that from Queen Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh, investing him with all such Territories in America as he should Discover and Plant, between the 33d and 40th Degrees of North Latitude, of which the following is an Abstract. Elizabeth, by the Grace of God, &c.—Know ye, that of our special Grace and mere Motion, we have given and granted, and by these Presents, for Us, our Heirs and Successors, do give and grant, to our trusty and well-beloved Walter Raleigh, Esq; and to his Heirs and Assigns for ever, free Liberty at all Times for ever hereafter, to Discover and View such remote, Heathen, and barbarous Lands and Territories, not actually possessed of any Christian Prince, or inhabited by Christian People, as to him and them shall seem good, and the same to have, hold, occupy, and enjoy, to him, his Heirs and Assigns, for ever, with all Prerogatives, Jurisdictions, Royalties, Privileges, and Franchises thereunto belonging, by See or Land: And the said Walter Raleigh, his Heirs and Assigns, are hereby impowred to build and fortify on such Land &c. at their Discretion. And we do likewise impower the said Walter Raleigh, his Heirs and Assigns, to take and lead in the said Voyage, or to inhabit there, as many of our Subjects as shall willingly accompany him or them, with sufficient Shipping and Necessaries for their Transportation. And further, the said Walter Raleigh, his Heirs and Assigns, shall hold, occupy, and Assigns, shall hold, occupy, and enjoy, all such Lands and Countries so to be discovered and possessed; and the Cities, Towns, Castles, and Villages in the same, with the Royalties, Franchises, and Jurisdictions thereof, with full Power, &c. reserving to Us, our Heirs and Successors, the fifth Part of all Gold and Silver Ore that shall be acquired or got in such Countries; and the same shall be holden of Us, or Heirs and Successors, by Homage, and the Payment of the said fifth Part, &c. in Lieu of all Services. And moreover, we do, by these Presents, grant, That the said Walter Raleigh, his Heirs, and Assigns, may encounter, expulse, and resist all such Persons as shall, without his or their Consent, attempt to inhabit in the said Countries, &c. And we do further grant to the said Walter Raleigh, his Heirs and Assigns, full Power and Authority to correct, punish, pardon, and govern, as well in Cases Capital as Criminal and Civil, all such of our Subjects as shall adventure themselves in the said Voyages, or inhabit such Lands or Countries according to such Laws and Statutes as shall be established by him and them, for the better Government of the said People; so as such Laws be as agreeable to the Laws of England as may be, and be not contrary to the Christian Faith, and so as the said People remain subject to the Crown of England. “Witness Ourself at Westminister, the 25th of March, 1584, and in the Twenty-sixth Year of our Reign.” As our Author chuses to consider the Colonies as unaliable from the Realm by the Crown, and as this is the first Royal Grant of American Territory to English Subjects, it may not be improper to consider the Title on which it is founded. The Pope was the first who assumed Authority to dispose of the Countries of Infidels, and that by his Apostolic Succession; and to this all Christian Princes submitted, when the East was granted to Portugal, and the West to Spain. But his Right in this Particular being afterwards questioned, every European Prince assumed the same Authority, and liberally granted away the Dominion and Property of Pagan Countries; judging, undoubtedly, that Christianity could alone give a Title to the Enjoyment of this World, or the next. And however ridiculous this may now appear, it is evident, that Queen Elizabeth’s Grant was founded on no other Title, even from the Patent itself; because, had she been vested with any Right to those Countries, which was not common to all Christian Princes, the Reservation in Favour of any Christian Sovereigns, by whom those Countries might be possessed, would never have been inserted. And, indeed, it was impossible the Queen could have had any other Title to the Territory in question, unless it was derived from Sebastian Cabot’s Discovery of the Northern Continent of America, near one Hundred Years before. But Discovery, (at best a very slender Title,) when unattended with Possession or Occupancy, (which alone could give it any Validity,) during the long Interval that succeeded, and especially when the Property of the discovered Country was already vested in its natural Proprietors and Inhabitants, certainly could afford but a very indifferent Right: Nor does it appear, that Cabot ever discovered the Country which was granted by this Patent. But however valid the Queen’s Title to the Lands then granted in America might be, it was vested in herself only; and no Person will affirm, that the Nation had any Claims thereto, or that that Part of America, situated between the 33d and 40th Degrees of North Latitude, was then annexed to the Realm; and I believe it will be difficult to prove, that it has been since united thereto, or indeed, that any Power, after it had been legally granted to others, could annex it to the Realm without their Consent. If therefore the Crown, by Discovery or otherwise, acquired a Title to any Part of America, it belonged to the Crown alone, and could be for ever alienated from the Realm, either to Subjects or Foreigners, at the Pleasure of the Crown. As it is an indisputable Maxim, that every Acquisition of foreign Territory is at the King’s absolute Disposal, and after being thus alienated from the Realm, cannot be again united to it, without Consent of its Proprietors. Whether the Territory of the Colonies has been in this Manner alienated, their several Charters will best determine. As to Queen Elizabeth’s Charter to Sir Walter Raleigh, it was a modified Grant of the Sovereignty of that Country, with all the Privileges necessary to constitute a distinct State, to be held of the Crown by Homage, &c. the Queen divesting herself of all Share in the Legislative and Executive Authority, prescribing, however, for her own Security, a Model for its Constitution, as agreeable as might be to that of England; for that this was the End of the Limitation therein contained, relative to its Laws, will fully appear hereafter. This Charter, after many unsuccessful Attempts to settle a Colony in Virginia, being forfeited by Sir Walter Raleigh’s Attainder, King James the First, by Letters Patent, dated the 10th of April, 1606, in the Fourth Year of his Reign, created the two Virginia Companies, authorizing them to plant Colonies in America, between the thirty-fourth and forty-fifth Degree of North Latitude; granting them for that Purpose, “all the Lands, Woods, Soil, Grounds, Havens, Ports, Rivers, Mines, Minerals, Marshes, Commodities, Fishings, Hereditaments, Jurisdictions, &c. within the same,” and authorizing them to “inhabit and remain there, and also build and fortify within the same;” declaring that no other of his Subjects should “be permitted or suffered to inhabit or plant therein,” without their Licence. The Colonies, when planted, were to be governed each by a Council of thirteen Persons, agreeable to such Laws, Ordinances, &c. as should be transmitted to them by his Majesty, under his Sign Manual or Privy Seal, and were authorized to “establish and cause to the made a Coin to pass current there, of such Metal, and in such Form, as the said several Councils there shall limit and appoint:” His Majesty therein declaring, that all his Subjects inhabiting the said Colonies, or their Children born therein, should “have and enjoy all Liberties, Franchiefs, and Immaunities, within any of his other Dominions, to all Intents and Purposes, as if they had been abiding and born within this his Realm of England:” A Declaration which (with others of a similar Nature in every America Charter) expressly implies, that the Colonies were not intended to be within the Realm of England. A council was likewise established here, similar to the Privy Council of England and Ireland, for the superior Direction of these Colonies; and the Exercise of the Power it was wested with would have been incompatible with any other Constitution than that of distinct States. Through the Whole of this Charter, the Colonies are considered as being without the Realm, and not the least Provision is made therein for their Dependance, either on the Laws or Legislature of England, which are even named in the Patents. In 1609, a second Charter was granted to the Treasurer and Company of Virginia, to enlarge and explain their Privileges, by which they were erected into “one Body or Commonalty perpetual,” and vested with the Property of that Country and the Islands lying within one Hundred Miles of the Shores of both Seas, with all their Commodities, Jurisdictions, Royalties, &c. to be holden of the King, his Heirs and Successors, as of his Manor of East Greenwich, in free and common Soccage, paying only one fifth of all Gold and Silver Ore to be obtained therein, in Lieu of all Manner of Services; vesting in the Council for the said Company, first appointed by the King, and afterwards chosen by themselves, with the Approbation of the Lord Chancellor, “full Power and Authority to make, ordain, and establish and Manner of Orders, Laws, Directions, Instructions, Forms, and Ceremonies of Government and Magistracy, fit and necessary for, and concerning the Government of, the said Colony, and the same to abrogate, revoke, or change at all Times, not only within the Precincts of the said Colony, but also on the Seas in going or coming to or from the said Colony,” without any Reservation for securing their Dependance on the Laws, or Parliament of this Kingdom, which are here likewise nameless. It is likewise especially provided, that the said Company, “and every of them, their Factors, and Assigns, shall be free of all Subsides and Customs in Virginia, for the Space of one-and-twenty Years, and from all Taxes and Impositions for ever, upon any Goods or Merchandizes at any Time or Times hereafter, either upon Importation thither, or Exportation from thence.” —The third Charter from the King, dated March 12, 1611–12, grants to the Treasurer and Company of Virginia, all Islands lying in the Sea, and within Three Hundred Miles of Virginia, to be held in the same Manner, and with the same Privileges, as the rest of that Province; and especially ordains, that there shall be four Times in each Year, “for ever, one great, general, and solemn Assembly, which four Assemblies shall be stiled and called the Four Great and General Courts of the Council and Company of Adventurers of Virginia: In all and every of which said Great and General Courts, so assembled, our Will and Pleasure is, and we do, for Us, our Heirs and Sussessors, for ever, give and grant to the said Treasurer and Company, or the greater Number of them so assembled, that they shall and may have full Power and Authority, from Time to Time, and at all Times hereafter, to elect and chuse discreet Persons to be of our said Council for the first Colony of Virginia, and to nominate and appoint such Officers as they shall think fit and requisite, for the Government, managing, ordering and dispatching of the Affairs of the said Company, and shall likewise have full Power and Authority to ordain and make such Laws and Ordinances for the Good and Welfare of the said Plantation, as to them, from Time to Time, shall be thought requisite and meet, so always as the same be not contrary to the Laws and Statutes of this our Realm of England.” This is the first Instance in which King James the First ever divested himself of all Share in the Legislative and Executive Authority of any American Colony: And here, for the first Time, we find him adding a Clause for limiting the Power of Legislation therein, to a Conformity with the Laws of England, similar to that contained in Queen Elizabeth’s Charter to Sir Walter Raleigh, which, though properly omitted in the preceding Charter, in which the King had reserved to himself a Power of restraining their Legislation, was now become necessary for limiting those Laws which he could never afterwards revise or repeal, to the end that the Authority, thus solemnly granted, might not be perverted to his own Disadvantage; and to prevent this, by prescribing a Form and Model for their Civil Constitution, over which the Royal Prerogative could afterwards have no Power, he wifely inserted the aforesaid Clause; and for the same cogent Reason it was afterwards copied into the Charters of Massachusetts Bay, Maryland, &c. with some Variations; as that their Laws should “be consonant to Reason, and not repugnant or contrary, but as near as conveniently may be, agreeable to the Laws, Statutes, and Rights of this our Kingdom of England;” a Mode of Expression which alone proves, that the Clause was not inserted to bind the Colonies to obey Acts of Parliament, but only to limit and modulate their Government and Laws upon Principles conformable to the Constitution of England: And agreeable to this, we find, that the Government of Virginia, upon the Arrival of Sir George Yardly, soon after this Patent had been obtained, was new modelled, that it might “resemble the British Constitution composed of two Houses of Parliament and a Sovereign: The Number of the Council was increased, intending this Body should represent the House of Lords, while the House of Commons was composed of Burgesses assembled from every Plantation and Settlement in the Country.” Mod. Univers. Hist. It would, indeed, have been absurd and unnecessary to invest the Colonies with the Power of Legislation, if the Laws of England were to extend thither. Besides, the Limitation in Question is very insufficient to authorize any such Extension, as their Laws might be very dissimilar, but not repugnant to the Laws of England. And we find that Crimes which, in this Kingdom, are punishable with Death, in some of the Colonies have only a pecuniary Punishment, et vice versa; the Laws of England, in general, never having had any Force in America; and the Lords of Council having determined, “that Acts of Parliament not naming the Colonies, shall not bind them:” And if the Clause of Limitation does not give Validity to all Acts of Parliament in America, without Discrimination, it certainly does not to any particular ones. But natural and obvious as this Construction must appear, the Opponents to the Colonies will by no Means admit of it, having singled out this restraining Clause as sufficient to authorize the Extension of Parliamentary Taxation of America; and our Author asserts, that the Colonies cannot pretend that their Obedience to Parliamentary Authority “has been altered or released by Charters, or Authorities, from the Executive Power; for, on the contrary, Obedience to the Laws of Great Britain, without any Restriction, is expressly reserved in every one of them.” Thus we see the Sense of this restraining Clause, which has been Copied into all the Charters, perverted, and Conclusions boldly drawn there-from, unwarrantable by reason or Justice. How, then, is the true Intent and Meaning of this Clause, for limiting the Legislative Acts of the Colonies, to be discovered? James and Charles, by whom (after Elizabeth) this Clause was primarily inserted in the American Charters, and whose Conduct, in this Particular, was the Example followed in adding it to the subsequent Charters for Colonization, are long since dead, and unable to give the desired Explanation. If, however, it should be found that these Monarchs, by any Acts of theirs, had clearly and indubitably explained their Intention relative to the Clause in Question, it would be all that can possibly be expected or required; and I flatter myself that an Explanation of this Nature would receive the Assent of the most prejudiced Person on this Subject, even of Mr. Grenville himself; and at the present Æra, when Posts of Honour and Profit are prostituted as Rewards to those, who, by Artifice and Sophistry, are most successful in subverting the Claims of the Colonies, I am particularly happy in reciting Facts which discover the Intention of the Clause in Question, or at least prove beyond Contradiction, that it was not inserted to render the Colonies subject to Parliamentary Authority, or render the Laws of England valid in America. The Charter which provides that the Laws of Virginia shall not be contrary to the Laws and Statutes of England, bears Date the 12th of March, 1612; and on the 25th of April, 1621, soon after the Constitution of Virginia had received that Form it has ever since retained, when a Bill was proposed in the House of Commons for granting to the Subjects of England free Liberty of Fishing on the Coast of America, the House was told by the Secretary of State, from his Majesty, that America was not annexed to the Realm, and that it was not sitting that Parliament should make Laws for those Countries; and though the House was uncommonly sollicitous for this Bill, and often offered it for the Royal Assent, it was always refused by the Crown, for those very just and cogent Reasons. And the King’s Successor, Charles the First, by whom the Plymouth, Masschusetts, and Maryland Charters were soon after granted, when the same Bill was again offered, refused it the Royal Assent, declaring, at the same time, that it was “unnecessary; that the Colonies were without the Realm and Jurisdiction of Parliament, and that the Privy Council would take order in Matters relating to them;” though a little after, when the Maryland Charter was granted, he reserved to the Subjects of England the same Right of Fishing upon the Coast of that Province, which was intended to be secured by the Bill that was denied the Royal Assent; which abundantly proves, that the King did not refuse the Bill for any secret Reasons, but only because he thought it might afford a Precedent for an unwarrantable Extension of Parliamentary Jurisdiction. Will any Pason, who is informed of these Facts, believe those Kings who repeatedly denied their to every Act relating to America, because it was without the Realm and Jurisdiction of Parliament, could have inserted the Clause in Question, to render Virginia, Massachusetts Bay, Maryland. &c. subject to the Authority of Parliament? Or that the Colonies were not by them considered as distinct States, not dependent on the Authority of the English Legislature? And yet, if this should be granted, and if the Crown (as is evident) had a Right to constitute distinct States in America; and if the Colonies, according to the Royal Intention and Construction, were so constituted, and if they were peopled and planted on this Principle and Condition, it will follow, as a necessary Consequence, that no Power on Earth could after wards unite them to the Realm of England, or subject them to the Authority of its Parliament, without their own special Consent, given in the same formal and solemn Manner as was done by the Kingdom of Scotland, at its Union with England; and that every Act of Parliament, which has hitherto bound them is an Infringement of their Rights, The Settlement of New-England followed that of Virginia, and was occasioned by a noble Disdain of civil and religious Tyranny, the very Object for which it was solely undertaken being an Emancipation from the Authority of Parliament, and those Grievances which they suffered under the Laws of England; an Object for which they had before retired to foreign Countries, particularly Holland; where they remained till Sir Robert Naunton, then Secretary of State, convinced his Majesty of the Impolicy of unpeopling his own Dominions, by religious Oppression, for the Benefit of his Neighbours, and obtained Leave for the Puritans to settle in America, for which they embarked in Holland, having previously treated with the Virginia Company for a Tract of Land near Hudson’s River. But upon their Arrival in America, they found themselves at Cape Cod, where the Season of the Year obliged them to land, thought it was without the Limits of the Virginia Company’s Patent, and their future Settlement, consequently, could not be held by them from any European Prince or State. In this Situation they considered themselves as having reverted to their native Freedom; but being desirous still to continue under the Allegiance and Protection of their former Sovereign, they executed the following Instrument, which was signed by all the Heads of Families. In the Name of God, Amen! We, whose Names are underwritten, the loyal Subjects of our dread Sovereign Lord King James, by the Grace of God of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith, &c. having undertaken, for the Glory of God and the Advancement of the Christian Faith, and the Honour of our King and Country, a Voyage to plant the first Colony in the Northern Parts of Virginia, do, by thee Presents, solemnly and mutually, in the Presence of God and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a Civil Body Politick for our better ordering and Preservation, and Furtherance of the Ends aforesaid, and by Virtue hereof, to enact, constitute and frame such just and equal Laws, Ordinances, Acts, Consttitutions, and Officers, from Time to Time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient, for the general Good of the Colony, unto which we promise all due Submission and Obedience. “In Witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed our Names, at Cape God, Nov. the 11th, 1620.” This was the Constitution of the Colony of New Plymouth, the Inhabitants acquiring a most equitable Title to their Lands by Purchase and Cession from its natural Proprietors, the Indian Tribes. King James, however, soon after their Embarkation for America, had established a Council at Plymouth, in the County of Devon, “for the planting, ruling, ordering, and governing of New-England in America, and granting to them, their Successors and Assigns, all that Part of America lying and being in Breadth from forty Degrees of Northerly Latitude from the Equinoctial Line, to the forty-eighth Degree of the said Northerly Latitude, inclusively; and in Length, of and within all the Breadth aforesaid, through out all the main Lands from Sea to Sea, together with all the firm Lands, Soils, Grounds, Havens, Ports, Rivers, Waters, Fishings, Mines, Minerals, precious Stones, Quarries, and all and singular other Commodities, Jurisdictions, Royalties, Privileges, Franchises, and Pre-eminences, both within the said Track of Land upon the Main, and also within the Islands and Seas adjacent,” to be holden of his said Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, as of his Manor of East-Greenwich, in free and common Soccage, yielding and paying to, &c. the fifth Part of all Gold and Silver Ore to be obtained therein, “for and in Respect of all and all Manner of Duties Demands, and Services.” To this Grant was likewise added the sole and exclusive Power of Legislation, and of electing and constituting all Officers of Government, both Civil and Military, together with Authority to coin Money, make War and Peace with the Indians, and all other Privileges necessary for their distinct and independent Government: And the Colony of New Plymouth falling within this Grant, the Inhabitants, a few Years after, purchased the entire Right of the Patentees to that Part of the Country, with all their Rights, Privileges, and Immunities. “Thus the Colony became a Kind of Republick by Patent from King James I. whereby they were enabled to chuse a Governor, Council, and General Court, who should have full Power of making and executing all Laws, which should be judged necessary for the Publick Good, the Sovereignty being still reserved to the Crown of England.” —Neal’s History of New-England. The Colony of Massachusetts was settled for the same End, and from the same Motives, as that of New-Plymouth; first under the Sanction of a Patent from the Council established at Plymouth, and the next Year by a Charter from King Charles the First, bearing Date the 4th of March, in the Fourth Year of his Reign, whereby the Adventurers and Inhabitants were created “one Body Politick and Corporate in Fact and Name, by the Name of the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay in New England,” and invested with Powers, Liberties, and Privileges, similar to those of the Colony of New-Plymouth. Before this, however, King James had, by a Proclamation, dated the 15th of July, 1624, dissolved the Virginia Company, and received the Colony into his own immediate Dependence; which alarmed its Inhabitants, and produced a Remonstrance from them to the Throne, in which they expressed their Apprehensions of “Designs formed against their Rights and Privileges.” To quiet these, the Lords of Counil, in a Letter, dated the 22d of July, 1634, assured them from his Majesty, “ That all their Estates, Trade, Freedom, and Privileges, should be enjoyed by them in as extensive a Manner as they enjoyed them before the Recall of the Company’s Patent;” and their former Constitution and Laws were accordingly established and confirmed. The Charter of Maryland, which followed that of the Massachusetts Bay, was granted to Cecilius Baron of Baltimore, by Charles the First, in the Eighth Year of his Reign, and invests the said Lord Baltimore, his Heirs and Assigns, with the Territory and Country of Maryland, and Islands adjacent, together with all their “Commodities, Jurisdictions, Privileges, Prerogatives, Royal Rights, &c. &c. of what Kind soever, as well by Sea as by Land:” In the fullest and most ample Manner constituting and appointing the “said Lord Baltimore, his Heirs and Assigns, true and absolute Lords and Proprietaries of the said Country, and of all the Premises aforesaid; saving always the Faith and Allegiance, and Sovereign Dominion, due to Himself, his Heirs, and Successors, to be holden of the Kings of England as of their Castle of Windsor, in free and common Soccage, by Fealty only, and not in Capte, or by Knights Service, yielding and paying, therefore, to the said King, his Heirs, and Successors, two Indian Arrows of those Parts, to be delivered at his said Castle of Windsor, every Year, the second Tuesday in Easter Week; and also the fifth Part of all Gold or Silver Ore within the Limits aforesaid, which shall from Time to Time happen to be found. Granting also for himself, his Heirs and Successors, full and absolute Power to the said Lord Baltimore, his Heirs, &c. for the good and happy Government of the said Country, to ordain, make, enact, and, under his or their Seals, to publish any Laws whatsoever, appertaining either to the publick State of the said Province, or to the private Utility of particular Persons, according to their best Discretion, by and with the Advice, Assent, and Approbation of the Freemen of the said Province, or the greater Part of them, or of their Delegates or Deputies, whom, for the enacting of the said Laws, when and as often as need shall require, we will, that the said now Lord Baltimore, and his Heirs, shall assemble, in such Sort and Form, as to him and them shall seem best; and the said Laws duly to execute upon all People within the said Province or Limits thereof, for the time being, or that shall be constituted under the Government and Power of him or them, either sailing towards Maryland, or returning from thence towards England, or any other of our Dominions, by Imposition of Penalties, Imprisonment, or other Punishment; yea, if it shall be needful, and that the Quality of the Offence require it, by taking away Members, or Life, either by him the said now Lord Baltimore, and his Heirs, or by his or their Deputies, Lieutenants, Judges, Justices, Magistrates, Officers, and Ministers, to be ordained and appointed according to the Tenor and true Intention of these Presents: And likewise to appoint and establish any Judges, Justices, Magistrates, and Offices whatsoever, at Sea and Land, for what Cause soever, and with what Power soever, and in such Form, as to the said now Lord Baltimore, or his Heirs, shall seem most convenient: Also to remit, release, pardon, and ablish, whether before Judgment or after, all Crimes and Offences whatsoever against the said Laws, and to do all and every other Thing or Things which unto the complete Establishment of Justice unto Courts, Pratories, and Tribunals, Forms of Judicature, and Manners of Proceedings do belong, although in these Presents express Mention by not made thereof; and by Judges by them delegated, to award Process, hold Pleas, and determine in all the said Courts and Tribunals, all Actions, Suits, and Causes whatsoever, as well criminal as civil, personal, real, mixed and pretorial; which Laws, so as aforesaid, to be punished, our Pleasure is, and so we enjoin, require, and command, shall be most absolute and available in Law, and that all the liege People and Subjects of us, our Heirs and Successors, do observe and keep the same inviolably in these Parts, so far as they concern them, under the Pains therein expressed, or to be expressed; provided nevertheless, that the said Laws be consonant to Reason, and be not repugnant, or contrary, but as near as conveniently may be, agreeable to the Laws, Statutes, and Rights of this our Kingdom of England.” (A Limitation very expedient, for the Reasons which I have before recited) Granting also to the said Lord Baltimore, &c. full Power and Authority to ‘build and fortify Castles, and other Places of Strength, for the publick and their own private Defence;’ ordaining, that the said Country should be of his Allegiance, and its Inhabitants, Denizens and Lieges of the said King, &c. of their Kingdoms of England and Ireland; and empowering ‘the said Lord Baltimore, his Heirs, &c. or their Captains, or other Officers, to levy, muster, and train, all Sorts of Men, of what Condition, or wheresoever born, within the said Province, and to make War, and pursue their Enemies, as well by Sea as by Land, even without the Limits of the said Province, and to vanquish and take them, and to put them to Death by the Law of War, or save them, at their Pleasure,’ and to exercise the Law Martial upon all offending Persons, and ‘to confer Favours, Rewards, and Honours, upon such of the Inhabitants within the said Province as shall deserve the same; and invest them with what Titles and Dignities soever he or they shall think fit;—and to erect and incorporate Boroughs and Cities with convenient Privileges and Immunities.’ Authorizing the said Lord Proprietor, his Heirs, &c. ‘to make and constitute, within the said Province, and the Isles and Iselts aforesaid, such and so many Sea Ports, Harbours, &c. with such Rights, Jurisidictions, Liberties, and Privileges, as to him or them shall seem most expedient.’ Granting for himself, his Heirs and Successors, ‘unto the said Lord Baltimore, his Heirs and Assigns, that he the said Lord Baltimore, &c. may, from Time to Time, for ever, have and enjoy the Customs and Subsidies within the said Ports, Harbours, &c. within the Province aforesaid, payable or due for Merchandizes and Wares, there to be laden and unladen; the said Subsides and Customs to be reasonably assessed, (upon any Occasion,) by themselves and the People there as aforesaid, to whom we give Power by these Presents, for us, our Heirs and Successors, upon just Cause, and in due Proportion, to assess and impose the same.’ To this is added the following Covenant between the King and Inhabitants of the said Province, by which they are formally and positively exempted from every Species of Foreign Taxation; viz. ‘And further our Pleasure is, and by these Presents, for us, our Heirs and Successors, we do covenant and grant to and with the said now Lord Baltimore, and his Heirs and Assigns, that we, our Heirs and Successors, shall at no Time hereafter set or make, or cause to be set or made, any Imposition, Custom, or other Taxation, Rate, or Contribution whatsoever, in and upon the Dwellers and Inhabitants of the aforesaid Province, for their Lands, Tenements, Goods, or Chattels, within the said Province, or to be laden or unladen within the Ports of Harbours of the said Province. And our Will and Pleasure is, and for us, our Heirs and Successors, we charge and command, that this our Declaration, shall henceforward, from Time to Time, be received and allowed before all our Courts, and before all the Judges of us, our Heirs and Successors, for a sufficient and lawful Discharge, Payment, and Acquittance; commanding all and singular our Officers, and Ministers of us, our Heirs and Successors, and enjoining them, upon Pain of our high Displeasure, that they to not presume, at any Time, to attempt any Thing to the contrary of the Premises, of that they do in any Sort withstand the same; but that they be, at all Times, aiding and assisting, as fitting, unto the said now Lord Baltimore, and his Heirs, and to the Inhabitants and Merchants of Maryland aforesaid, their Ministers, Servants, Factors, and Assigns, in the full Use and Fruition of the Benefit of this our Charter.’ Whoever considers these, and various other Privileges, too numerous to recite, which have been granted to the Province of Maryland in this Charter, by which the King divests himself, his Heirs, &c. of all Share in the Legislative and Executive Authorities of Government within the said Province, and formally exempts its Inhabitants from foreign Taxation, alienating to the Lord Proprietor, &c. all Customs, Duties, Subsidies, &c. collected in any of its Ports or Harbours, with all the Prerogatives and Privileges necessary to a distinct and sovereign State, will easily perceive, that their Exercise and enjoyment must have been incompatible with a Subjection to Parliamentary Authority; that in Reality, the Constitution of Maryland was not capable of, or intended for, any such Subjection, and that no Provision for any Species of Legislative Dependance, in that, or any former Colony, to this Kingdom, was made; as I have already sufficiently proved, that the Clauses in their Charters, which prescribe a Similitude between their Laws, and those of England, imply no such Dependance, since the Kings by whom they were inserted, ever decleared them to be without the Realm of England, and Jurisdiction of its Parliament. I know it has been asserted, that the Clause of Exemption from foreign Impositions in the Maryland Charter, was not designed to preclude Parliamentary Taxation, but only to secure the Inhabitants from Impositions by the King’s Prerogative; and indeed this is more than probable, as the Extension of Parliamentary Taxation to America was then so little thought of, that a Clause to prevent it would have been deemed as unnecessary, as was the Law against Paricides at Rome. But that the King meant to reserve to his Parliment a Right of taxing the Colonies, will hardly be believed, by one who knows that he considered them as without the Jurisdiction of that Parliament; nor will it appear probable, that he would, in that Cafe, have granted to the Lord Proprietor all Duties, Customs, and Subsidies raised in that Province, and vested the Right of raising them solely in the Legislature of the Province itself. Besides, if the English Parliament had a Right of taxing the Province, its Inhabitants must, of Necessity, have been English Subjects, and therefore could not have been taxed by Prerogative, so that the whole Clause in that Case must have been destitute of Use, Sense, or Meaning, and consequently never would have been inserted; neither could the Inhabitants of Massuchusetts Bay, New Plymouth, &c. after their Charters were vacated by a Judgment in the Court of Chancery, in the 39th Year of Charles the Second, if they had been considered as English Subjects, have been taxed by Sir Edmund Andros, the King’s Governor, and a Council of three or four Persons appointed by the King, without the Consent of any Assembly or Parliament of the People, which was evidently repugnant to the Great Charter of King John, in which the King engages, “not to impose any Taxes without summoning the Archbishops, the Abbots, the Earls, the greater Barons, and the Tenants in Capite.” And if the English Parliament was then the Legislative Power of the Colonies, and their Constitutional Representative, as our Author asserts, its Interposition in Behalf of the injured Inhabitants of those Colonies was a Duty necessarily incumbent on them, as the Guardians and Protectors of the Rights of English Subjects, though it never was discharged towards those Colonies, nor did they, not withstanding their frequent Remonstrances, ever obtain any Relief, until they procured it for themselves, by imprisoning the King’s Governor, and restoring their original Form of Government, a Measure which afterwards received King William’s Approbation. To this let me add, that when King William afterwards applied to the Judges, to know whether he might lawfully appoint a Governor for the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, (its Charter being then vacated) they declared, that without entering into the Merits of those Complaints on which the Charter had been cancelled, it having been vacated by a Judgment in Chancery, “the King might, by his Prerogative, put the Inhabitants of that Colony under whatever Form of Government he pleased.” Which clearly proves, that the Judges did not then think those Colonists to be English Subjects, because the King, in that Case, could not, by his Prerogative, “put them under whatever Form of Government he pleased.” By English Subjects, at present, I mean no more, than Persons obliged to obey Acts of an English Parliament; because that Obligation is necessarily connected with a Right to the Enjoyment of all the Privileges of Englishmen. But to return from this Digression. We have now examined the most important of all the Americau Charters granted before the Restoration, and indeed all of them that merit Attention, and these abundantly prove, that the Colonies were not then considered as annexed to the Realm of England, or subject to its Laws. In what State then shall we consider them? I have already proved, that whatever Right Elizabeth, James, and Charles had to the Lands they granted in America, it was vested solely in themselves, either personally, or as Sovereigns of this Realm. The latter Conclusion appears most favourable to our Author’s Purpose, at least he has argued strongly in its Support; and as I am not disposed to maintain an unnecessary Dispute, I will assent to it; as I well know he can infer no other Consequence therefrom, than that the Territory of America being the Property of the Crown, until it is alienated thereform, must attend the Succession of the Crown, as an Appendage thereto; and this, if it be necessary, will serve to explain the Reason why the Colonies, being without the Realm, have yet in variably continued within the Allegiance of the English Crown, notwithstanding its different Revolutions: An Explanation that will sufficiently expose the Impropriety of our Author’s Question, Page 137. where he asks the Colonies, “What King it is they profess themselves the loyal Subjects of? Adding, It cannot be his present most gracious Majesty, George the Third, King of Great Britain, for his Title is founded on an Act of Parliament; and they will not surely acknowledge that Parliament can give them a King, which is of all others the highest Act of Sovereignty, when they deny it to have the Power to tax or bind them in any other Case, although they must see, that if they reject Parliamentary Authority, they make themselves to be still the Subjects of the abjured Stuart Race.” Had our Author been acquainted with the History of the Colonies, he would have known, that they have ever recognized and proclaimed the rightful Kings of England: That in Virginia Charles the Second was proclaimed King of England, Scotland, France, Ireland, and Virginia, (that Colony then considering itself a distinct State,) long before his Restoration; and that he actually reigned in that Colony a considerable Time before he was King in England; and that in the Massachusetts Bay the Prince and Princess of Orange were Proclaimed, before it was known that they were invested with Sovereignty in England. But the Allegiance of the Colonies to the Succession of the English Crown, whether that is governed by lineal Descent or Acts of Parliament, is especially provided for by Clauses for that Purpose in their Charters as James and Charles, though they did not consider the Colonies as annexed to the Realm, intended, nevertheless to connect them to it, by securing their Subjection to the same Sovereign. Let me now return to the Title of Elizabeth, James, and Charles, to the Lands in America, which, whether more or less valid, was, as I have already declared, vested in themselves only, either personally or as Possessors of the English Crown, and that when they granted the Territory of Virginia, New England, Maryland, &c. they were constitutionally authorized to dispose of it either to Foreigners or Subjects, in any Manner whatsoever; it being an unquestionable Truth, that the Kings of England may constitutionally alienate for ever from the Crown and Realm, without Consent of Parliament, any Acquisition of Foreign Territory, whether by Cession, Conquest, or Discovery, not being already with the Royal Assent formally annexed to the Realm. This is a Proposition so universally acknowledged, that not one of the many Proofs that may be alledged in its Support is necessary; and I am sure that our Author, however he might endeavour to evade the Question, will never deny the Validity of the several Grants of Territory from the Crown to the Colonies; how then will he be able to defend his unwarrantable Conclusions, (Pages 75 and 76.) to prove that the Lands in America were originally within the Realm and Jurisdiction of Parliament? Can any thing, which is at the sole and absolute Disposal of the King, be the Property of the Nation, and under the Controul of its Parliament? Inconsistent Absurdity! Nor is our Author’s long Quotation from Mr. Locke (Pages 76 and 77.) at all pertinent to the Subject.—It indeed argues, that he who receives an Inheritance in “a Commonwealth, must take it with the Condition it is under, that is, of submitting to the Government of the Commonwealth, under whose Jurisdiction it is, as far forth as any Subject of it.” But has this Assertion of Mr. Locke the least Tendency to prove, that those who received the Lands in America should submit to the Government of a Commonwealth, or Kingdom, to which these Lands were never annexed? Impossible! Thus, then, the Validity of the several Grants of Territory from the Crown to the Colonies is indisputable: The King’s Right of emancipating their Inhabitants from the Jurisdiction of Parliament, and of erecting them into distinct States, remains next to be considered; and this our Author, among other Opponents to the Colonies, has denied, and endeavoured to support his Denial by the most fallacious, and sometimes impertinent Arguments; such are those from Page 70 to 78.— “That the first Inhabitants of the Colonies were part of the British Community, and bound to obey its Legislative Power, in all Respects, as any other Subjects, at the Time of the Establishments of these Colonies,” I will not deny; but he certainly proposes a very unnecessary and improper Question, in asking whether “the Executive Power of the Crown can, by any Grant or Authority, alter or annual the Legislative Power in the Article of Taxation, or any other?” Nor is Mr. Locke’s Assertion, that “even the Legislative Power itself cannot transfer the Power of making Laws to any other Hands; for it being but a delegated Power from the People, they who have it cannot pass it over to others,” at all applicable to the present Subject. Mr. Locke therein justly observes, that the Parliament cannot transfer to others its Authority of making Laws over those by whom this Authority has been delegated to itself; but no where even insinuates, that the Parliament, after having constantly recognized and assented to the King’s Prerogative Right of permitting his Subjects to withdraw themselves from the Realm, and the Jurisdiction of its Laws, cannot permit them to enter into a second Community, and throw off their Subjection to the first. On the contrary, Mr. Locke repeatedly declares, that a Man, by being born in a State, is thereby under no Obligation to continue therein; that all Men, being by Nature free, have a Right “to choose what Society they will join themselves to, and what Commonwealth they will put themselves under.” This being the Case, and the first Inhabitants of our Colonies having a just Right to separate themselves, and the King a Constitutional Right to permit them to separate themselves, from the Community, and having granted them an Accession of foreign Territory, which he had a legal right to alienate for ever from the Crown and Realm, even to Foreigners, what Law or Principle in the English Constitution, forbids their retiring to the Territories so granted in America, and there, by the Consent of their Sovereign, becoming distinct States, on the Terms and Privileges stipulated between their King and themselves? Whoever places the Settlement of the Colonies in this just Point of View, will immediately discover the Fallacy of all those Arguments which have been objected to the Power of the Crown, in granting their Inhabitants an Emancipation from the Authority of Parliament.—As long as they continued within the Realm as a collective Part of its Inhabitants, and received Protection from its Laws and Government, no Power whatever could possibly exempt them from Obedience to its Legislative Authority: But this Obligation to Obedience necessarily depended on the Term of their Continuance within the Community, and naturally ceased on their Separation from it; and though the King’s Prerogative extends, indiscriminately, to all States owing him Allegiance, yet the Legislative Power of each State, if the People have any Share therein, is necessarily confined within the State itself, it being repugnant to the Laws of Nature and Nations for the Subjects of one State to exercise Jurisdiction over those of another: The People being allowed to participate the Legislative Authority, thereby to preserve their own Freedom, not invade that of others. This our Author admits, when he acknowledges, that “it may be pretended that the Lands in America, lying without the Realm, and appertaining to the King only, their Possessors cannot, from those Circumstances, be subject to the Jurisdiction of Parliament, whose Authority is consined within the Limits of the Realm.” He indeed presumes, that this Plea “cannot be made by the Inhabitants of such Lands as were as were conquered by the Forces of the British State from foreign Powers, or ceded to Great Britain by Treaty: Those Conquests or Cessions (says he) are surely the Dominions of the Crown of Great Britain, not the private Property of the King.” But in this he is likewise mistaken, nor did Mr. Dickenson mean to “put these intirely out of the Question, in all that he says about the Rights of the Colonies.” And whatever Opinion our Author may entertain of this Subject, it is an indisputable Fact that no Territory, acquired either by Conquest or Cession, is thereby rendered a Part of the Realm, but remains at the absolute Disposal of the King, till by the Royal Assent it is formally annexed to the Kingdom; and of this the late Act of Parliament for rendering Gibraltar unalienable from Great Britain, by the Crown, is a sufficient Proof; and our Author, I am very sure, will not pretend that the Nation could, by Discovery, acquire a better Title to the Country in America, than by Cession or Conquest. He, however, endeavours to prove, that the Territory possessed by the Colonists in America, was originally the Property not of the King, personally, but of the Crown of England, and from thence infers, that they must necessarily be a Part of the Realm: This, however, is a very unwarrantable Inference, as the holding a Country under the English Crown, by no Means renders it a Part of the Kingdom; to prove this, I need only instance the Isle of Man, which was granted to Sir John Stanly, and his Heirs, by Henry the Fourth, and has been held as a Dependence from the Crown, by a Tenure similar to that of the Colonies, (in every Respect material to the present Question,) though it never was considered as Part of the Realm, or subjected to its Laws, until the late Change made in its Constitution, by Consent of its King. Thus have I abundantly demonstrated the Right of the Crown to grant the Colonists the Constitution and Privileges of distinct States; and whether this Constitution and these Privileges have been granted them, let the Facts, which I already have, and shall hereafter recite, declare. But before I proceed farther in the political History of the Colonies, it is proper for me to consider some Facts and Arguments, which have been alledged by our Author, to prove that they were not originally deemed distinct States by the King and Nation. The Debates of the House of Commons, of May 1614, February 1620, and April 1621, related only to the Expediency of encouraging or discouraging the Importation and Use of Tobacco in England, and tended in no respect to extend the Authority of Parliament to America; and the Fishing Bill, brought into the House the 25th of April, 1621, was only an Attempt in the Commons to secure to the Subjects of this Kingdom the Privilege of Fishing on the Coasts of America, which the King deemed an Infringement of the Privileges he had before granted the Colonies; for which Reason, joined to the Consideration of their being without the Realm, and Jurisdiction of its Parliament, he refused the Royal Assent thereto, as did his Successor for the same Reasons. And whoever will peruse the various Debates on this Subject, will discover, that the principal Arguments were confined to the Expediency, rather than the Right, of granting free Liberty of Fishing in America to the King’s English Subjects, with the necessary Incidents of drying Fish, and using Wood, which (as was asserted) would be of no Detriment to the Colonies, because of no Value there, declaring it a Hardship on the English to be prohibited Fishing in America, while the French and Dutch were allowed to do it; observing, that the English formerly enjoyed that Liberty, but that the Colonists then obliged them “to compound for Places, or took away their Salt, or exacted great Sums, and even fired Ordnance at them.” To these Assertions, however, it was objected, that the Fishermen injured the Colonies, and that they were not Objects of Parliamentary Legislation. The Secretary of State in particular declared, that though he never would strain the Prerogative against the Good of the Commonwealth, yet that it was “not fit to make any Laws here for those Countries, they not being annexed to the Crown;” (and if this was then the Case, I believe it will be difficult for our Author to prove them the Domains of the Crown, much less the Dominions of the Nation.) In answer to these Objections, against the Right of Parliament, nothing material was urged by the Advocates for the Bill: Mr. Brooke, indeed, very sagaciously alledged, that “if the King gave his Assent to the Bill, it would controul the Patent;” but he did not pretend, or even seem to think, that the King’s Act in that particular would acquire any additional Force from the Authority of the Lords and Commons. Sir Edward Cooke also represented the Clause in Sir Francis Gorges’s American Patent, declaring, “That no Subject is of England should visit the Coast upon Forfeiture of Ship and Goods,” as a Grievance, because, says he, “this is to make a Monopoly of the Sea, which is wont to be free,” and that the exclusive Grant of Liberty to pack and dry Fish on that Coast, was likewise attempting a Monopoly of “the Wind and Sun.” But the Man, who from these Debates will discover Proofs in Support of the Right of Parliament to legislate for the Colonies, must certainly discover what has no Existence. As to the Act of the Commonwealth Parliament, which our Author has alledged against the Colonies, I shall only observe, that it is by no Means strange that an Assembly, which had usurped the Right of the King and Lords, should also infringe the Rights of the People of Virginia and the West Indies, who had denied, and at the same time actually resisted, its Authority: But when that Assembly declared, that these Colonies had, “ever since the Planting thereof, been, and ought to be, subject to such Laws, Orders, and Regulations as are or shall be made by the Parliament of England;” and it is known that at that time no Laws ever had been made by the Parliament of England for the Colonies, this Declaration will doubtless appear somewhat ludicrous—But the Degree of Dependance, which this Parliament thought it had a Right to exact from these Colonies, will best appear, by the Treaty concluded between Virginia and the Commissioners of Parliament, who were sent with an Armament to reduce it to Obedience to the Commonwealth.—The Articles of this Treaty were as follow: First, The Plantation of Virginia, and all the Inhabitants thereof, shall be and remain in due Subjection to the Commonwealth of England; not as a conquered Country, but as a Country submitting by their own voluntary Act; and shall enjoy such Freedoms and Privileges as belong to the free People of England. Second, The General Assembly, as formerly, shall convene and transact the Affairs of the Colony. Third, The People of Virginia shall have a free Trade, as the People of England, to all Places and all Nations. Fourth, “Virginia shall be free from all Taxes, Customs, and Impositions whatsoever; and none shall be imposed upon them without Consent of their General Assembly; and that neither Forts nor Castles be erected, nor Garrisons maintained without their Consent.” These Conditions will likewise serve to convey a just Idea of the Rights and Privileges to which the Inhabitants of Virginia then thought themselves intitled: And though the Dependance imposed on them by these Articles was little more than nominal, they were so far from thinking these Privileges any considerable Acquisition, that in January 1659, they restored Sir William Berkley, proclaiming “Charles the Second, King of England, Scotland, France, Ireland, and Virginia,” some Time before his Restoration to England. These are the most important Occurrences in the Political History of the Colonies preceding the 12th Year of the Reign of Charles the Second, an Æra which produced the first Act of Parliament of any Kind, that ever was extended to America, since the Settlement of British Colonies in that Quarter of the Globe. This Act was, indeed, passed for the wisest and best of Purposes, that of increasing the English Trade and Navigation, by prohibiting the Importation into, and Exportation of, all Goods and Commodities out of “any Lands, Islands, Plantations or Territories to his Majesty belonging, or in his Possession, or which may hereafter belong unto, or be in Possession of, his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, in Asia, Africa, and America, except in Ships belonging to the People of England or Ireland, or the said Lands, Islands, and Plantations,” and navigated by the Inhabitants of these several Places. It is however to be lamented, that the then Parliament had not thought proper to discover, for the Information of Posterity; the Source from whence it derived the Right of making Laws, not only for all Countries under his Majesty’s Dominion in Asia, Africa, and America, but for all Countries which her Easter may belong to, or be in the Possession of “his Heirs and Successors,” as it must doubtless have been new and hitherto undiscovered; since, however extensive the King’s Prerogative may be over his foreign Subjects, the English Constitution has made no Provision for this Species of National, External Legislation, the Power of Parliament being originally confined to the Limits of the Realm, and the Nation collectively, of which it was the Representing and Legislative Assembly. How far the Parliament, of which I am now speaking, departed from the primitive Spirit of our Constitution, let others judge:—But certain it is, that future Kings of Great-Britain may acquite Territories which Parliamentary Authority ought not to control; and yet this Act will necessarily bind them, if situated either in Asia, Africa, or America, as it now would Hanover, had not the Word Europe been omitted in the Act as unnecessary, from the apparent Improbability of the King’s making any future Acquisitions of European Territory, which might not be comprehended within the Kingdoms of England or Ireland. But how the Parliament, at that Time, acquired a Right of Legislating for the Colonies in America is to me inconceivable—Virginia, Masschusetts Bay, New Plymouth, Maryland, Connecticut, New Haven, New Hampshire, and the Province of Main were then the only Colonies held under the English Crown on the Continent of America; and in all these the People enjoyed the sole Legislative and Executive Powers of Government, (Virginia excepted) they having all been settled on the Faith of Charters, granted either by James or Charles the First, who, according to their own Construction, had constituted them distinct States, and such they had been reputed till the 12th of Charles the Second: How then could the Parliament of England, after the Colonies had been thus constitutionally alienated from the Roalm, and settled on the Faith of those fundamental and indefeasible Stipulations by which they were so aliensted, make Laws for their Government, consistent with the Principles of Justice? Were the Colonies previously united to the Kingdom? Or could any Authority whatever raise them to it, without their formal and express Consent. The Answers to these Questions are obvious, and will sufficiently demonstrate, that though a Right of Legislating for the Colonies was then assumed by Parliament, it would have been difficult to support the Assumption by Law or Equity. The Rectitude and Utility of a Measure tending to encrease the English Shipping and Navigation, was doubtless obvious; and as some of the King’s Settlements in Africa, &c. were mere Factories without Legislative Power, and as in others it might have been tedious, and perhaps impracticable, to obtain the Consent of their several Assembles to this Law, the Legislature of this Kingdom was, perhaps, from these Considerations, encouraged to exercise a Power, (in that particular Instance,) evidently tending to the general Good; or, at least, if these were not the Motives to this Law, perhaps they were not less exceptionable. Two Years afterwards, that is, in the 14th Year of Charles the Second, the Colonies of Connecticut, and New Haven, petitioned his Majesty to unite them into one Colony, by a new Charter. The King was by that Time, become jealous of his Prerogative in the Colonies; but by the wife Interposition of the Earl of Clarendon, then Lord Chancellor, his Majesty granted the Charter, with Privileges in Effect as extensive as any that had ever been granted to any Colony; securing to himself their Allegiance only, without the smallest Share in the Legislative and Executive Powers of Government; and the next Year Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations obtained from the King a Charter, with Privileges in every Respect similar to those granted the Colony of Connecticut. I have not hitherto interrupted the Course of my Observations, to remark on our Author’s very fallacious, partial, and unfair Extracts from the Charters of the several Colonies, which must be obvious to any one, who will compare them with their Originals, or even with those Passages which I have faithfully recited from them. How he will reconcile an Attempt to impose on his Readers, by such Artifices, with the Principles of common Honesty, is best known to himself; certain I am, however, that his Purpose ought to be much better than it appears, to justify the use of such low and ungenerous Means for its Execution. Our Author’s erroneous Account of the Connecticut and Rhode-Island Charters, (without recurring to those of Virginia, Maryland, &c.) will furnish a sufficient Instance of that Fallacy which I have just censured, and at the same Time afford the Reader a just Idea of that Degree of Credit which ought to be reposed in his Assertions, as well as of the “Honesty of his Purpose,” in reviewing the American Controversy. “The Charters, (says he,) dated in the 14th Year of Charles the Second, which were granted to the Inhabitants of Connecticut, and Rhode-Island, are simply Charters of Incorporation, erecting the respective Inhabitants in those Places into a Corporate Body, and empowering them to do Corporate Acts, in like Manner as other Corporations in England are empowered to do:” And in Support of this very erroneous Assertion, he recites a single Clause extracted from those Charters, and then sagaciously adds, “The Man who thinks the Terms of this Clause of the Connecticut and Rhode Island Charters, descriptive of, or applicable to, a Sovereign State, or Supreme Legislature, deserves not that any sober Argument should be held with him.” But whatever Degree of Truth there may be in this Conclusion, I will venture to affirm, that if he had recited those Clauses in these Charters which are most pertinent to the Controversy, there is no Man deserving a sober Argument who would have compared the Colonies of Connecticut and Rhode Island, to simple English Corporations. That I may not unnecessarily extend these Observations, I shall offer the Reader an Account of the Constitution of these Colonies, as presented to the House of Lords in January 1734, rather than transcribe the different Clauses of the Charters themselves, which would require a greater Extent. “Connecticut and Rhode Island (say the Commissioners,) are Charter Governments, where almost the whole Power of the Crown is delegated to the People, who make an Annual Election of their Assembly, their Councils, and their Governors, likewise to the Majority of which Assemblies, Councils, and Governors respectively, being Collective Bodies, the Power of making Laws is granted; and as their Charters are worded, they can and do make Laws even without the Governor’s Assent, no negative Voice being reserved to them as Governors in said Charters.—These Colonies have the Power of making Laws for their better Government and Support, and are not under any Obligation, by their respective Constitutions, to return authentic Copies of their Laws to the Crown for Approbation and Disallowance, or to give any Account of their Proceedings; nor are their Laws repealable by the Corwn, but the Validity of them depends on their not being contrary, but, as near as may be, agreeable to the Laws of England.” To this Account of the Constitution of these Colonies, many other important Privileges might have been added by the Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, (whose Impartiality, I presume, no Person will suspect:) These, however, are not necessary, as the smallest Knowledge of the present State of Connecticut and Rhode Island, will abundantly demonstrate, that their internal Constitution is perfectly distruct and independent; all the Authority of their Governments being vested in the People, or the Officers elected by them, no Civil or Military Officer, in these Colonies, having the smallest Dependence on the Crown; not even their Troops are subject to the King’s Authority, as they have repeatedly refused Obedience to his Generals, particularly when King William appointed Benjamin Fletcher, Esq; Governor of New-York, to command them; a Refusal which their Charters amply justified. As to our Author’s Remarks, that the in the Charters of Connecticut and Rhode Island, “expresly admis that these Colonies were then within the Realm of England, or annexed to it, by using these Words, As other our liege People of this our Realm of England, or any other Corporation within the same,” I shall observe, that the indeterminate Application of the Word other, in this Particular, might have furnished some Protect for this Remark, could it be supposed that he was ignorant of several other Clauses in these Charters, which entirely preclude the Sense he has attempted to impose thereon thereon. In each of these Charters, the King expresly covenants, that “All and every the Subjects of us, our Heirs, &c. who shall go to inhabit within the said Colony, and every of their Children, which shall happen to be born there, &c. shall have and enjoy all the Liberties and Immunities of free and natural Subjects, within any of the Dominions of us, our Heirs, and Successors, to all Intents, Constructions, and Purposes whatsoever, as if they and every of them were born within the Realm of England.” And in the Preamble to the Charter of Rhode-Island, the King expresses, that its Inhabitants “did, by the Consent of our Royal Progenitors, transport themselves out of this Kingdom of England into America.” But numerous Clauses to this Effect, are found in the Charters of all the Colonies, and in every Publick Act relating to them; and even without these, which are perfectly incompatible with the Sense of our Author’s Remarks, there are too many Instances of the vague, and even improper Use of the Word other, in the American Charters, to warrant the Conclusion he has drawn, from its Application to the present Instance. Thus in the third Virginia Charter, Art. XI. is the following Expression, “All such, and so many of our loving Subjects, or any other Strangers, that will,” &c. from which, however, no Person will infer, that the King’s loving Subjects are Strangers, though this Conclusion would be as justifiable, as that contained in our Author’s Remark. To this let me add the following Extract from the Connecticut and Rhode Island Charters, (for in both it is exactly the same,) which abundantly proves that the King then not only deemed these Colonies without the Realm, but was sensible, that he had retained but little more than a nominal Sovereignty over them, and that he could no otherwise punish any Crimes or Misdemeanors committed by them, than by withdrawing his Protection from them, or putting them out of his Allegiance.
