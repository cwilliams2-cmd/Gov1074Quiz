Wells (277/56)To the Honorable Convention for forming a New Constitution for theState of the Massachusetts BayThe Proceedings of the Freemen of the Town of Wells in Relationto the New Constitution as proposed by the Convention unanimously agreed upon by the Inhabitants of said Town at their Meeting held onthe 27th. day of April and continued by Adjournment to Monday the22nd. day of May 1780 Seventy Four Voters being presentWe have considered the Declaration of Rights with the Frame ofGovernment agreed upon by the Deligates of the People of the Stateof the Massachusetts Bay in Convention and our Opinion of the sameis as follows VizThe Declaration of Rights in the several Articles We approve andhave no Objection to any thing therein contained.The Frame of Government We find in the Main agreable to ourMinds and are of Opinion that it might be for the Interest of the PeopleIOR COиmyof this State that the same be Received and confirmed inarticles.735the followingWe are of Opinion that the important Ends of Government would belikely to be much better answered if the Governor might have a Negativeon all Acts of the Legislature. We think it very necessary that the Independance of the Executive and Judicial Departments be well secured--Nor can We conceive how this can be done effectually unless there be aPower lodged somewhere of negativing such legislative Acts as tend todestroy or violate this Independancy-And We are clearly of opinionthat the Governor will be the most fit person to be intrusted with thisPower; he being the first Magistrate and the Sole Representative of thewhole Commonwealth; The Center of Union to all the several parts andmembers of the political Body; who is chosen and constituted by the whole Community to be in a peculiar manner the Guardian of the Constitution and of the Rights and Interests of the whole State-Allthe Individuals have a like Interest in him and stand in a like Relation tohim as their common Representative-We can not but think it would beextreemly dangerous and impolitick to trust an trust an incontroulable Powerof Legislation in the Hands of those who are only the Representativesof particular and smaller Districts of the Commonwealth; who may oftenbe disposed to act upon the private narrow Views and Interests of theirparticular Constituents to the prejudice of the publick Welfair and the Injury of other parts of the Community-When we consider that the several Members of the Legislative Body are to be chosen only by particular Districts as their special Representatives and may not improbablybe often chosen for the very purpose of serving and promoting suchViews and Designs of their Constituents as would be injurious to otherparts of the State. We cannot but think that the Representatives of the Whole People who can have no reason to act under the Influence of suchpartial Biases and Respects should be furnished with ample and Sufficient Powers to prevent effectually the pernicious Consequences ofsuch narrow Policy, as is calculated to serve the Interest of one part tothe injury of another who may happen not to have an equal Interest inLegislature And this Precaution seems the more reasonable andnecessary when We consider it is no ways incredible or improbable-itmay sometimes hapen that a Thin House of Representatives and Senators in which but a small part of the Common wealth is represented and the distant parts may Scarce havea single Member to Speak and act ontheir Behalf may be prevailed upon to pass Bills injurious, oppressive andthe736 35. Returns of the Townsperniciousa to great part of the people, which if they are suffered to havethe Force of Laws would not only operate to the damage of many individuals but also occasion discontents Factions and disunions dangerousto the Commonwealth-As We with divers other parts of the State arelike to be always remote from the Seat of Government and can seldom if ever expect to be equally represented in the Legislature or to have anequal Interest in the same with those parts of the State that are near theCapital. We cannot think it safe that an uncontroulable power of disposing of our Persons and properties should be vested in a Legislaturein which it may sometimes happen that we are not represented and byReason of our distance are seldom likely to have an equal Interest in itwith most of our fellow CitizensBut We shall always haveaRepresentative in the Person of the Governor. we may claim an equalInterest in him with the other parts of the State. If a partial or mis- Vguided Legislature should bear hard upon us his Protection may beclaimed his Justice may be appealed to his Interposition may reasonablybe hoped for-We therefore think it highly reasonable and necessary thatthe common Representative of the people, who may sometimes be ourprincipal or only Representative in the general Court chosen by us to acton our behalf, may have his Hand at full Liberty and may be empoweredto act effectually and with strong Arm for the Protection of all andevery part of his Constituents as there may be occasionNor can we think there can be any danger in deligating ample powersto the common Representative for the publick Service in Superintendingthe Affairs of the Commonwealth-Dependant as he must be upon theSuffrage of the People for the Authority by which he is to act; it is hardto imagine what Temptation he could be likely to have to abuse his Power of Negativing wantonly to the Vexation and detriment of his Constituents and Fellow Citizens-We may well presume that he would seldom if ever refuse and disallow any Bills passed by the Legislatureunless the Reasons for doing so were weighty and plain so that he couldventure an appeal upon them to the Judgement and Conscience of thePeople in general-And We hope that a man who shall have so large ashare in the Esteem and Confidence of the people as to be chosen by themto be their common Representative and the guardians of their Rights andRevisor of their Laws would seldom be found so destitute of Wisdomand virtue as to be unworthy of the trust reposed in him or however wecan scarce conceive what sufficient inducement a man of any Reflectioncould have wantonly to disoblige his Constituents on whom his political131Existance depends and draw upon himself their just Resentments-wefear that he would rather be too cautious of interposing his Authorityso often as there might be just occasion for it And We are the more confirmed in their apprehensions because we cannot learn that our governorsunder the late Constitution, though holding their Commissions intirelyat the pleasure of the British Crown have been wont to abuse theirnegativing power to the injury and vexation of the subject unless whenthey have acted by special Instructions-We are also of Opinion that anegative power in the common Representative upon the legislative Actswould much discourage the projecting or passing iniquitous Bills calculated to serve the private Interest and narrow views of a part to theprejudice of the publick since the promoters of such Designs must haveReason to apprehend that the Governor,would interpose his Authority todefeat such Attempts and have the approbation of his Constituentsgeneral for so doing. inSection 1 Article and for preventing The Method proposed Chapter 1these Evils seems to us inadiquate and attended with manifold inconveniencies. It is no incredible Supposition that Two Thirds of those whomay sometimes vote in both Houses of the Legislature may not be chosento represent more than a Sixth part perhaps of the persons and propertyof the Commonwealth-That they may be drawn by Interest prejudiceand the influence of designing men to favour the Views of a powerfulparty to the injury of others-Nor with the Methods of voting by yeasand Nays be any great Restraint upon those who may presume that theBills however iniquitous will not be disagreable to the majority of theirparticular Constituents--And in Case an injurious and impolitick Billshould happen to pass in this manner though perhaps contrary to themind of the greater part of the People no orderly and Constitutional waywould be left for preventing the pernicious Effects of it--Besides Weapprehend that the method of proceeding prescribed in this Article incase a Bill should be objected to by the Governor would greatly retardand Clog the Dispatch of Business which might in some cases occasion agreat Expence and be otherwise very prejudicial to the publick InterestFor these reasons with others which might be mentioned we are fullyand clearly of Opinion that it would be much for the Bennefit of theCommonwealth that the governor as the common Representative mighthave a Negative upon all Legislative Acts-We have opened our Sentiments and Reasons more fully on this Article because We think it apoint of great Importance to our Fellow Citizens in general and particularly to ourselves and others in similar Circumstances.2. We are also of Opinion that a House of Representatives to be Chosen in the methods proposed in Chapter I Section 2 Article 2nd would be at present much too numerous for the convenient Dispatch of Business besides the great Expence to the publick which would be ocса- sioned thereby And this Inconvenience will be likely to increase con- tinually in a proportion to the increasing Numbers of the people And We apprehend that the several parts of the State will be likely to be much more unequally represented upon that plan than would be the Case if larger Districts were apportioned to each Representative-We presume not to determine what Number of Representatives would be best suited to answer the Ends of Government, but We desire they maybe Reduced to a Conveniant Number which we apprehend with Submission ought not to exceed Two Hundred.3. Whereas it is provided and declared Chapter 2nd Section I Article 2that no person shall be eligible to the Office of Governor unless he shall declare himself to be of the Christian Religion we cannot but think thatthe safety peace and Wealfare of a protestant Commonwealth require that its Governor declare himself to be a protestant since it has been found by Experience that a protestant People cannot be happy under the government of those who are of the Roman Church. That Authorityand Jurisdiction which the Bishop of Rome claims over the wholeChristian World and which all who belong to that Church must bepresumed to acknowledge and submit to is We apprehend contrary to a fundamental principal of the Constitution laid down in the 4rth Articleof the Declaration of Rights-We apprehend that a Papist is at leastunsuitable to be Chosen and admitted to the Office of Governor ininthis Commonwealth, as one that makes no profession of the Christian asReligion4 We also object to and disapprove the Methods of appointing the Officers of the Militia proposed Chapter 2 Section I Article ro Fromwhat we have observed and heard we are of Opinion that since themethod of appointing Officers by Election has been practised, there has frequently been more dissatisfaction and discontent than has formerlybeen known in Consequence of which military Authority has been weakened and relaxed so that it has often been scarce possible for the Officersto execute the Order of their Superiors. We know of no inconveniencethat has been found to arise from the governors having the appointmentI OR LOunmy 739of all military officers and it is our mind that the appointing as well as Commissioning such Officers should be by the governor as Captain general.5 We should also think it were better if the Senators and Representatives might be at liberty annually to elect any person to the Office of Treasurer and Receiver general for as many years successively as they may think proper. And that that Clause in Chapter 2 Section 4 Article 1 which declares that No man shall be eligible to this Office more than Five years successively, may sometimes prove an inconvenient Restraint upon the Electors from continuing a person in this Office whom they may judge most proper for it. And that a better Way might be found to answer the End aimed at in this Restriction.6 We are also of Opinion that it would be highly expedient that the Meeting of a Convention in the year 1795 for the express purpose of Revising the Constitution and forming such alterations as from Experi- ence shall be found necessary be absolutely ordained and determined on and not left suspended upon the Vote of Two Thirds of the Voters through the State. We think it is-in a manner certain that Corrections and Amendments will by Experience be found needful. That it must be the work of Time and Experience to adjust a plan of government fora Commonwealth so wisely and happily in all its parts that the impor- tant Ends of its political union may be well provided for and aa proper Guard be set against those Abuses both of Liberty and Power which would be dangerous or detrimental to the Interest and happiness of the State-And that the best precautions should be taken that the way may be kept open for applying Seasonable effectual orderly and constitutional Remedies to such Disordirs and Violations of the Constitution as may be observed and for supplying whatever be found to be deficient and correcting what may be found amiss in the plan proposed. These Objections with the grounds and reasons of them We propose with due defference to the honourable Convention for their impartial Consideration-We have no Intention or desire to obstruct the Establish- ment of a new Form of government in the State which we think is much needed-We are free to declare our Consent to and acceptance of the Draught and Model which has been laid before us by the honourable Convention in all the Articles of it except those which we have here particularly objected to-And if the Alterations and Amendment We have proposed should be disapproved by the Convention we consent towave them however reasonable they may appear to us rather than the748 35.
