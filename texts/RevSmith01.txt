I charged the author of Common Sense with perverting the Scripture in his account of the origin of the Jewish monarchy ... this matter must be treated more seriously, for the sake of a country, in which (God be thanked) the Scriptures are read and regarded with that reverence which is due to a revelation from Heaven; I must therefore endeavour to rescue, out of our author’s hands, that portion of the sacred history, which he has converted into a lible against the civil constitution of Great-Britain ... Here our author erects his standard, and here he compliments himself with the mockery of triumph ‘That the Almighty hath here entered his protest against monarchial government is true, or the scripture is false.’—But I will take the liberty to say, that the scripture is true, and that this author’s inference is horribly false the Almighty would have as strongly expressed his displeasure against the Jews, had they rejected his government for one of their own appointment whether it had been Monarchial or Democratical—to be administered by one man or a thousand men ... I contend for this—That where a people are left to chuse their own forms of government as has been the case of all the world for some thousand years, there is no particular denounciation of God’s displeasure against any Form whether Monarchial or Democratical, under which such a people may think their civil happiness best secured, and their duty to God best performed… You call on me to shew my plan? I have done it… a safe return to a connection with our ancient friends and kindred, accompanied with all the advantages we have formerly experienced, and perhaps more; which I trust are things yet practicable; or, if it should prove otherwise, we can lose nothing by the exercise of deliberation and wisdom in the mean while ... although you ought to have counted the cost of your work, and have tried to reconcile with your design, a multitude of interests, commercial, political, and oeconomical—you have only entertained us with some loose declamations upon abuses in the English government; and shocked us, for want of better arguments, by a perversion of things sacred; filling the papers with personal invectives, and calumnies against all who cannot swallow, at a venture, every crude notion, you may cook up as the politics of the day. This will as little agree with the stomachs of others as with mine; although I have declared that, when the last necessity comes, I have no expedient in view but to take my chance with you, for better and for worse.
