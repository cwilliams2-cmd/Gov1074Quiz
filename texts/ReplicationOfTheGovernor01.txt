THE Proceedings of such of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston as assembled together and passed and published their Resolves or Votes as the Act of the Town at a legal Town-Meeting, denying in the most express Terms the Supremacy of Parliament, and inviting every other Town and District in the Province to a•opt the same Principle and to establish Committees of Correspondence to consult upon proper Measures to maintain it, and the Proceedings of divers other Towns, in Consequence of this Invitation, appeared to me to be so unwarrantable and of such a dangerous Nature and Tendency, that I thought myself bound to call upon you in my Speech at Opening the Session, to join with me in discountenancing and bearing a proper Testimony against such Irregularities and Innovations.I stated to you fairly and truly, as I conceived, the Constitution of the Kingdom and of the Province so far as relates •o the Dependance of the latter upon the former; and I desired 〈◊〉, if you differed from me in Sentiments, to shew me with Candour my own Errors, and to g•veyour Reasons in support of your Opinions, so far as you might differ from me. I hoped that you would have considered my Speech by your joint Committees, and have given me a joint Answer; but, as the House of Representatives have declined that Mode of Proceeding, and as your Principles in Government are very different, I am obliged to make separate and distinct replies.I shall first apply myself to you,Gentlemen of the Council,The two first Parts of your Answer, which Respect the Disorders occasioned by the Stamp-Act and the general Nature of Supreme Authority, do not appear to me to have a Tendency to invalidate any Thing which I have said in my Speech; for, however the Stamp-Act may have been the immediate Occasion of any Disorders, the Authority of Parliament was notwithstanding denied in Order to justify or excuse them. And, for the Nature of the Supreme Authority of Parliament, I have never given you any Reason to suppose that I intended a more absolute Power in Parliament, or a greater Degree of active or passive Obedience in the People, than what is founded in the Nature of Government, let the Form of it be what it may. I shall, therefore, pass over those Parts of your Answer without any other Remark. I would also have saved you the Trouble of all those Authorities which you have brought to shew, that all Taxes upon English Subjects must be levied by Virtue of the Act not of the King alone but in Conjunctionwith the Lords and Commons, for I should very readily have allowed it; and I should as readily have allowed that all other Acts of Legislation must be passed by the same joint Authority, and not by the King alone.Indeed, I am not willing to continue a Controversy with you upon any other Parts of your Answer. I am glad to find that Independence is what you have not in Contemplation; and that you will not presume to prescribe the exact Limits of the Authority of Parliament; only, as with due Deference to it, you are humbly of Opinion, that, as all human Authority in the Nature of it is and ought to be limited, it cannot constitutionally extend for the Reasons you have suggested, to the levying of Taxes in any Form on his Majesty's Subjects of this Province.I will only oberve, that your Attempts to draw a Line as the Limits of the Supreme Authority in Government, by distinguishing some natural Rights as more peculiarly exempt from such Authority than the rest, rather tend to evince the Impracticability of drawing such a Line; and that some Parts of your Answer seem to infer a Supremacy in the Province at the same Time that you acknowledge the Supremacy of Parliament, for otherwise the Rights of the Subjects cannot be the same in all essential Respects▪ as you suppose them to be, in all Parts of the Dominions, "under a like Form of Legislature."From these, therefore▪ and other Considerations I cannot help flattering myself, that, uponmore mature Deliberation and in Order to a more consistent Plan of Government, you will chuse rather to doubt of the Expediency of Parliament's Exercising its Authority in Cases that may happen▪ than to limit the Authority itself, especially as you agree with me in the proper Method of obtaining a Redress of Grievances by constitutional Representations, which cannot well consist with a Denial of the Authority to which the Representations are made; and, from the best Information I have been able to obtain, the Denial of the Authority of Parliament, expresly or by Implication in those Petitions to which you refer was the Cause of their not being admitted, and not any Advice given by the Minister to the Agents of the Colonies.I must enlarge and be much more particular in my Reply to you,Gentlemen of the House of Representatives,I shall take no Notice of that Part of your Answer which attributes the Disorders of the Province to an undue Exercise of the Power of Parliament, because you take for granted, what can by no Means be admitted, that Parliament had exercised its Power without just Authority. The Sum of your Answer so far as it is pertinent to my Speech, is this.You alledge that the Colonies were an Acquisition of Foreign Territory not annexed to the Realm of England, and therefore at the absolute Disposal of the Crown; the King having, as youtake it, a constitutional Right to dispose of and alienate any Part of his Territories not annexed to the Realm—that Queen Elizabeth accordingly conveyed the Property, Dominion and Sovereignty of Virginia to Sir Walter Raleigh to be held of the Crown by Homage and a certain Render, without reserving any Share in the Legislative and Executive Authority—that the subsequent Grants of America were similar in this Respect, that they were without any Reservation for securing the Subjection of the Colonists to the Parliament and future Laws of England,—that this was the Sense of the English Crown, the Nation and our Predecessors when they first took Possession of this Country—that if the Colonies were not then annexed to the Realm they cannot have been annexed since that Time—that if they are not now annexed to the Realm they are not Part of the Kingdom, and consequently not subject to the Legislative Authority of the Kingdom; for no Country, by the Common Law, was subject to the Laws or to the Parliament but the Realm of England.Now if this your Foundation shall fail you in every Part of it, as I think it will, the Fabrick which you have raised upon it must certainly fall.Let me then observe to you that, as English Subjects, and agreeable to the Doctrine of Feudal Tenure, all our Lands and Tenements are held me•iately or immediately of the Crown, and although the Possession and Use or Profits be in the Subject, there still remains a Dominion in the Crown. When any new Countries are discoveredby English Subjects, according to the general Law and Usage of Nations, they become Part of the State, and, according to the Feudal System, the Lordship or Dominion is in the Crown and a Right accrues of disposing of such Territories, under such Tenure or for such Services to be performed as the Crown shall judge proper, and whensoever any Part of such Territories, by Grant from the Crown, becomes the Possession or Property of private Persons, such Persons, thus holding under the Crown of England, remain or become Subjects of England to all Intents and Purposes, as fully as if any of the Royal Manors Forests or other Territory within the Realm had been granted to them upon the like Tenure. But that it is now, or was when the Plantations were first granted, the Prerogative of the Kings of England to alienate such Territories from the Crown, or to constitute a Number of new Governments altogether independant of the Sovereign Legislative Authority of the English Empire. I can by no Means concede to you. I have never seen any better Authority to support such an Opinion than an anonimous Pamphlet by which I fear you have too easily been mislead, for I shall presently shew you that the Declarations of King James the First, and of King Charles the First, admitting they are truly related by the Author of this Pamphlet, ought to have no Weight with you; nor does the Cession or Restoration, upon a Treaty of Peace, of Countries which have been lost or acquired in War militate with these Principles, nor may any particular Act of Power of a Prince in selling or delivering up any Part of His Dominions to a foreign Prince or State against thegeneral Sense of the Nation be urged to invalidate them, and upon Examination it will appear that all the Grants which have been made of America are founded upon them and are made to conform to them, even those which you have adduced in Support of very different Principles.You do not recollect that, prior to what you call the first Grant by Q. Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh, a Grant had been made, by the same Princess, to Sir Humphrey Gilbert of all such Countries as he should discover which were to be of the Allegiance of her, her Heirs and Successors but, he dying in the Prosecution of his Voyage, a second Grant was made to Sir Walter Raleigh which, you say, conveyed the Dominion and Sovereignty without any Reserve of Legislative or Executive Authority being held by Homage and a Render. To hold by Homage, which implies Fealty, and a Render is Descriptive of Socage Tenure as fully as if it had been said to hold as of our Manor of East Greenwich the Words in your Charter. Now this alone was a Reserve of Dominion and Sovereignty in the Queen her Heirs and Successors and, besides this, the Grant is made upon this express Condition, which you pass over, that the People remain subject to the Crown of England, the Head of that Legislative Authority which, by the English Constitution, is equally extensive with the Authority of the Crown throughout every Part of the Dominions. Now if we could suppose the Queen to have acquired separate from her Relations to her Subjects, or in her natural Capacity, which she could not do, a Title to a Country discoveredby her Subjects and then to grant the same Country to English Subjects in her publick Capacity as Queen of England, still by this Grant she annexed it to the Crown. Thus by not distinguishing between the Crown of England and the Kings and Queens of England in their personal or natural Capacities, you have been led into a fundamental Error which must prove fatal to your System. It is not material whether Virginia reverted to the Crown by Sir Walter's Attainder or whether he never took any Benefit from his Grant, though the latter is most probable seeing he ceased from all Attempts to take Possession of the Country after a few Years Trial. There were, undoubtedly, divers Grants made by King James the First of the Continent of America in the Beginning of the 17th Century and similar to the Grant of Queen Elizabeth in this Respect, that they were dependant on the Crown. The Charter to the Council at Plimouth in Devon dated November 3d, 1620 more immediately respects us, and of that we have the most authentick Remains.By this Charter, upon the Petition of Sir Ferdinando Gorges a Corporation was constituted to be and continue by Succession forever in the Town of Plimouth aforesaid, to which Corporation that Part of the American Continent which lies between the 40° and 48° Degrees of Latitude was granted to be held of the King his Heirs and Successors as of the Manor of East Greenwich with Powers to constitute subordinate Governments in America and to make Laws for such Governments, not repugnant to the Lawsand Statutes of England. From this Corporation your Predecessors obtained a Grant of the Soil of the Colony of Massachusets-Bay, in 1627, and, in 1628, they obtained a Charter from King Charles the First making them a distinct Corporation, also within the Realm, and giving them full Powers within the Limits of their Patent; very like to those of the Council of Plimouth throughout their more extensive Territory.We will now consider what must have been the Sense of the King of the Nation and of the Patentees at the Time of granting these Patents. From the Year 1602 the Banks and Sea Coasts of New-England had been frequented by English Subjects for catching and drying Cod-Fish. When an exclusive Right to the Fishery was claimed, by Virtue of the Patent of 1620, the House of Commons was alarmed and a Bill was brought in for allowing a free Fishery, and it was upon this Occasion that one of the Secretaries of State declared perhaps as his own Opinion, that the Plantations were not annexed to the Crown and so were not within the Jurisdiction of Parliament. Sir Edwin Sandys, who was one of the Virginia Company and an eminent Lawyer, declared that he knew Virginia had been annexed and was held of the Crown as of the Manor of East Greenwich and he believed New-England was so also; and so it most certainly was. This Declaration, made by one of the King's Servants, you say shewed the Sense of the Crown and, being not secretly but openly declared in Parliament you would make it the Sense of the Nation also, notwithstanding your own Assertionthat the Lords and Commons passed a Bill that shewed their Sense to be directly the contrary. But if there had been full Evidence of express Declarations made by King James the First, and King Charles the First, they were Declarations contrary to their own Grants, which declare this Country to be held of the Crown and consequently it must have been annexed to it. And may not such Declarations be accounted for by other Actions of those Princes who when they were solliciting the Parliament to grant the Duties of Tonnage and Poundage with other Aids and were, in this Way, acknowledging the Rights of Parliament, at the same Time were requiring the Payment of those Duties with Ship Money, &c. by Virtue of their Prerogative?But to remove all doubt of the Sense of the Nation and of the Patentees of this Patent or Charter in 1620 I need only refer you to the Account published by Sir Ferdinando Gorges himself of the Proceedings in Parliament upon this Occasion. As he was the most active Member of the Council of Plimouth and as he relates what came within his own Knowledge and Observation his Narrative, which has all the Appearance of Truth and Sincerity, must carry Conviction with it. He says that soon after the Patent was passed and whilst it lay in the Crown-Office he was summoned to appear in Parliament to answer what was to be objected against it, and the House being in a Committee and Sir Edward Coke that great Oracle of the Law, in the Chair, he was called to the Bar and was told by Sir Edward that the House understood that a Patenthad been granted to the said Sir •erdinando and divers other noble Persons for establishing a Colony in New-England, that this was d••med a Grievance of the Common-wealth 〈◊〉 to the Laws, and to the Privileges of the Subject, that it was a Monopoly, &c. and he required the Delivery of the Patent into the House. Sir Ferdinando Gorges made no Doubt of the Authority of the House but submitted to their Disposal of the Patent as in their Wisdom they thought good "not knowing, under Favour, how any Action of that King could be a Grievance to the Publick seeing it was undertaken for the Advancement of Religion, the Enlargement of the Bounds of our Nation. &c. He was willing, however, to submit the whole to their honorable Censures." After divers Attendances he imagined he had satisfied the House that the planting a Colony was of much more Consequence than a simple disorderly Course of Fishing. He was, notwithstanding, disappointed and, when the Publick Grievances of the Kingdom were presented by the two Houses, that of the Patent for New-England was the first. I don't know how the Parliament could have shewn more fully the Sense they then had of their Authority over this new acquired Territory, nor can we expect better Evidence of the Sense which the Patentees had of it, for I know of no historical Fact of which we have less Reason to doubt.And now Gentlemen I will shew you how it appears from our Charter itself, which you say I have not yet been pleased to point out to you except from that Clause which restrains us frommaking Laws repugnant to the Laws of England, that it was the Sense of our Predecessors at the Time when the Charter was granted that they were to remain subject to the Supreme Authority of Parliament.Besides this Clause, which I shall have Occasion further to remark upon before I finish, you will find that, by the Charter a Grant was made of Exemption from all Taxes and Impositions upon any Goods imported into New-England, or exported from thence into England for the Space of twenty-one Years, except the Custom of five per Cent upon such Goods as, after the Expiration of seven Years, should be brought into England. Nothing can be more plain than that the Charter, as well as the Patent to the Council of Plimouth, constitutes a Corporation in England with Powers to create a subordinate Government or Governments within the Plantation, so that there would always be Subjects of Taxes and Impositions both in the Kingdom and in the Plantation. An Exemption for twenty-one Years implies a Right of Imposition after the Expiration of the Term, and there is no Distinction between the Kingdom and the Plantation. By what Authority, then, in the Understanding of the Parties, were these Impositions to be laid? If any, to support a System, should say by the King rather than to acknowledge the Authority of Parliament, yet this could not be the Sense of one of our principal Patentees Mr. Samuel Vassall who at that Instant, 1628, the Date of the Charter, was suffering the Loss of his Goods rather than submit to an Imposition laid by the King withoutthe Authority of Parliament; and to prove that a few Years after it could not be the Sense of the rest I need only to refer you to your own Records for the Year 1642 where you will find an Order of the House of Commons, conceived in such Terms as discover a plain Reference to this Part of the Charter, after fourteen Years of the Twenty-one were expired. By this Order the House of Commons declare that all Goods and Merchandize exported to New-England or imported from thence shall be free from all Taxes and Impositions both in the Kingdom and in New-England until the House shall take further Order therein to the contrary. The Sense which our Predecessors had of the Benefit which they took from this Order evidently appears from the Vote of the General Court, acknowledging their humble Thankfulness, and preserving a grateful Remembrance of the Honorable Respect from that high Court, and resolving that the Order sent unto them under the Hand of the Clerk of the Honorable House of Commons shall be entered among their Publick Records to remain there unto Posterity: And, in an Address to Parliament, Nine Years after, they acknowledge, among other undeserved Favours that of taking off the Customs from them.I am at a Loss to know what your Ideas could be when you say that if the Plantations are not Part of the Realm, they are not Part of the Kingdom, seeing the two Words can properly convey but one Idea and they have one and the same Signification in the different Languages from whence they are derived. I do not charge youwith any Design, but the equivocal Use of the Word Realm in several Parts of your Answer makes them perplexed and obscure. Sometimes, you must intend the whole Dominion which is subject to the Authority of Parliament, sometimes only strictly the Territorial Realm to which other Dominions are or may be annexed. If you mean that no Countries but the ancient territorial Realm can constitutionally be subject to the Supreme Authority of England, which you have very incautiously said is a Rule of the Common Law of England, this is a Doctrine which you will never be able to support. That the Common Law should be controuled and changed by Statutes every Day's Experience teaches, but that the Common Law prescribes Limits to the Extent of the Legislative Power, I believe has never been said upon any other Occasion. That Acts of Parliament for several Hundred Years past have respected Countries, which are not strictly within the Realm, you might easily have discovered by the Statute Books. You will find Acts for regulating the Affairs of Ireland, though a seperate and distinct Kingdom. Wales and Calais, whilst they sent no Representatives to Parliament, were subject to the like Regulations. So are Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, &c. which send no Members to this Day. These Countries are not more properly a Part of the ancient Realm, than the Plantations, nor do I know that they can more properly be said to be annexed to the Realm, unless the declaring that Acts of Parliament shall extend to Wales, though not particularly named shall make it so, which I conceive it does not in the Sense you intend.Thus, I think, I have made it appear that the Plantations, though not strictly within the Realm, have from the Beginning been constitutionally subject to the Supreme Authority of the Realm and are so far annexed to it as to be, with the Realm and the other Dependencies upon it, one intire Dominion; and that the Plantation or Colony of Massachusetts-Bay in particular is holden as feudatory of the Imperial Crown of England: Deem it to be no Part of the Realm it is immaterial, for, to use the Words of a very great Authority in a Case in some Respects analogous, "being Feudatory the Conclusion necessary follows, that it is under the Government of the King's Laws and the King's Courts in Cases proper for them to interpose, though (like Counties Palatine) it has peculiar Laws and Customs, Jura Regalia, and complete Jurisdiction at Home."Your Remark upon and Construction of the Words, not Repugnant to the Laws of England, are much the same with those of the Council; but can any Reason be assigned why the Laws of England as they stood just at that Period should be pitched upon as the Standard, more than at any other Period? If so, why was it not recured to when the second Charter was Granted, more than sixty Years after the first? It is not improbable that the original Intention might be a Repugnancy in general and, a Fortiori, such Laws as were made more immediately to Respect us, but the Statute of 7th and 8th, of King William and Queen Mary, soon after the second Charter, favours the latter Construction only, and the Province Agent, Mr. Dummer, in his muchapplauded Defence of the Charter, says that then a Law in the Plantations may be said to be repugnant to a Law made in Great Britain, when it flatly contradicts it so far as the Law made there mentions and relates to the Plantations. But, Gentlemen, there is another Clause both in the first and second Charter which, I think will serve to explain this or to render all Dispute upon the Construction of it unnecessary.—You are enabled to impose such Oaths only as are warrantable by, or not repugnant to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm. I believe you will not contend that these Clauses must mean such Oaths only as were warrantable at the respective Times when the Charters were granted. It has often been found necessary, since the Date of the Charters, to alter the Forms of the Oaths to the Government by Acts of Parliament, and such Alterations have always been conformed to in the Plantations.Lest you should think that I admit the Authority of King Charles the Second in giving his Assent to an Act of the Assembly of Virginia, which you subjoin to the Authorities of James the First and Charles the First, to have any Weight, I must observe to you that I do not see any greater Inconsistency with Magna Charta in the King's giving his Assent to an Act of a Subordinate Legislature immediately or in Person than when he does it mediately by his Governor or Substitute but, if it could be admitted that such an Assent discovered the King's Judgment that Virginia was Independent, would you lay any Stress upon it when the same King was from Time to Timegiving his Assent to Acts of Parliament which inferred the Dependence of all the Colonies, and had by one of those Acts declared the Plantations to be inhabited and peopled by his Majesty Subjects of England?I gave you no Reason to Remark upon the Absurdity of a Grant to Persons born within the Realm of the same Liberties which would have belonged to them if they had been born within the Realm, but rather guarded against it by considering such Grant as declaratory only, and in the Nature of an Assurance that the Plantations would be considered as the Dominions of England. But is there no Absurdity in a Grant from the King of England of the Liberties and Immunities of Englishmen to Persons born in and who are to inhabit other Territories than the Dominions of England, and would such Grant, whether by Charter or other Letters Patent, be sufficient to make them inheritable, or to intitle them to the other Liberties and Immunities of Englishmen, in any Part of the English Dominions?As I am willing to rest the Point between us upon the Plantations having been, from their first Discovery and Settlement under the Crown, a Part of the Dominions of England, I shall not take up any Time in remarking upon your Arguments to shew that since that Time, they cannot have been made a Part of those Dominions.The remaining Parts of your Answer are principally intended to prove that, under both Charters, it hath been the Sense of the People thatthey were not subject to the Jurisdiction of Parliament, and, for this Purpose, you have made large Extracts from the History of the Colony. Whilst you are doing Honor to the Book, by laying any Stress upon its Authority, it would have been no more than Justice to the Author if you had cited some other Passages which would have tended to reconcile the Passage, in my Speech to the History.—I have said that, except about the Time of the Anarchy which preceded the Restoration of King Charles the Second, I have not discovered that the Authority of Parliament had been called in Question even by particular Persons. It was, as I take it, from the Principles imbibed in those Times of Anarchy that the Persons of Influence, mentioned in the History, disputed the Authority of Parliament, but the Government would not venture to dispute it. On the contrary, in four or five Years after the Restoration, the Government declared to the King's Commissioners that the Act of Navigation had been for some Years observed here, that they knew not of it's being greatly violated and that such Laws as appeared to be against it were repealed, It is not strange that these Persons of Influence should prevail upon great Part of the People to fall in, for a Time with their Opinions and to suppose Acts of the Colony necessary to give Force to Acts of Parliament; the Government, however, several Years before the Charter was vacated, more explicitly acknowledged the Authority of Parliament and voted that their Governor should take the Oath, required of him, faithfully to do and perform all Matters and Things enjoined him by the Acts of Trade. I have not recitedin my Speech all these Particulars, nor had I them all in my Mind but, I think, I have said nothing inconsistent with them. My Principles in Government are still the same with what they appear to be in the Book you refer to, nor am I conscious that, by any Part of my Conduct, I have given Cause to suggest the contrary.Inasmuch as you say that I have not particularly pointed out to you the Acts and Doings of the General Assembly which relate to Acts of Parliament, I will do it now, and demonstrate to you that such Acts have been acknowledged by the Assembly, or submitted to by the People.From your Predecessors Removal to America until the Year 1640 there was no Session of Parliament, and the first short Session of a few Days only in 1640, and the whole of the next Session, until the withdraw of the King, being taken up in the Disputes between the King and the Parliament, there could be no Room for Plantation Affairs. Soon after the King's withdraw the House of Commons passed the memorable Order of 1642, and from that Time to the Restoration, this Plantation seems to have been distinguished from the rest, and the several Acts or Ordinances, which respected the other Plantations, were never enforced here, and, possibly, under Colour of the Exemption in 1642, it might not be intended they should be executed.For 15 or 16 Years after the Restoration, there was no Officer of the Customs in the Colony, except the Governor annually elected by thePeople, and the Acts of Trade were but little regarded, nor did the Governor take the Oath required of Governors by the Act of the 12th of King Charles the Second, until the Time which I have mentioned. Upon the Revolution the Force of an Act of Parliament was evident in a Case of as great Importance as any which could happen to the Colony. King William and Queen Mary were proclaimed in the Colony, King and Queen of England, France and Ireland, and the Dominions thereunto belonging, in the Room of King James, and this not by Virtue of an Act of the Colony, for no such Act ever passed, but by Force of an Act of Parliament which altered the Succession to the Crown, and for which the People waited several Weeks with anxious Concern. By Force of another Act of Parliament, and that only, such Officers of the Colony as had taken the Oaths of Allegiance to King James deemed themselves at Liberty to take, and accordingly did take the Oaths to King William and Queen Mary. And that I may mention other Acts of the like Nature together, it is by Force of an Act of Parliament that the Illustrious House of Hanover succeeded to the Throne of Britain and its Dominions, and by several other Acts, the Forms of the Oaths have from Time to Time, been altered, and by a late Act that Form was established which every one of us has complied with as the Charter in express Words requires and makes our Duty. Shall we now dispute whether Acts of Parliament have been submitted to when we find them submitted to in Points which are of the very Essence of our Constitution? If you should disown that Authority whichhas Power even to change the Succession to the Crown, are you in no Danger of denying the Authority of our most gracious Sovereign, which I am sure none of you can have in your Thoughts?I think I have before shewn you, Gentlemen, what must have been the Sense of our Predecessors at the Time of the first Charter, let us now, whilst we are upon the Acts and Doings of the Assembly, co••••er what it must have been at the Time of the second Charter. Upon the first Advice of the Revolution in England, the Authority which assumed the Government instructed their Agents to petition th• Parliament to restore the first Charter, and a Bill for that Purpose passed the House of Commons, but went no farther. Was not this owning the Authority of Parliament? By an Act of Parliament, passed in the first Year of King William and Queen Mary, a Form of Oaths was established to be taken by those Princes and by all succeeding Kings and Queens of of England at their Coronation, the first of which is, that they will govern the People of the Kingdom and the Dominions thereunto belonging, according to the Statutes in Parliament agreed on, and the Laws and Customs of the same. When the Colony directed their Agents to make their humble Application to King William to grant the second Charter, they could have no other Pretence than as they were Inhabitants of Part of the Dominions of England, and they also knew the Oath the King had taken to govern them according to the Statutes in Parliament; surely then, at the Time of this Charter also, it was the Sense of our Predecessors, as well as of the King and of the Nationthat there was and would remain a Supremacy in the Parliament. About the same Time, they acknowledge, in an Address to the King, that they have no Power to make Laws repugnant to the Laws of England. And, immediately after the Assumption of the Powers of Government by Virtue of the new Charter, an Act passed to revive for a limitted Time all the Local Laws of the Colonies of Massachusetts-Bay and New-Plimouth, respectively, not repugnant to the Laws of England. And, at the same Session, an Act passed establishing Naval Officers in several Ports of the Province, for which this Reason is given, that all undue Trading contrary to an Act of Parliament made in the 15th Year of King Charles the Second may be prevented in this their Majesty's Province. The Act of this Province passed so long ago as the second Year of King George the first, for stating the Fees of the Custom-House Officers, must have relation to the Acts of Parliament by which they are constituted, and the Provision made in that Act of the Province for extending the Port of Boston to all the Roads as far as Cape-Aod, could be for no other Purpose than for the more effectual carrying the Acts of Trade into Execution. And, to come nearer to the present Time, when an Act of Parliament had passed in 1741, for putting an End to certain unwarrantable Schemes in this Province, did the Authority of Government, or those Persons more immediately affected by it, ever dispute the Validity of it? On the contrary, have not a Number of Acts been passed in the Province, that the Burdens to which such Persons were subjected might be equally apportioned, and have not allthose Acts of the Province been very carefully framed to prevent their militating with the Act of Parliament? I will mention also an Act of Parliament made in the first Year of Queen Ann; altho' the Proceedings upon it more immediately respected the Council. By this Act no Office Civil or Military shall be void by the Death of the King, but shall continue six Months, unless suspended or made void by the next Successor. By Force of this Act, Governor Dudley continued in the Administration six Months from the Demise of Queen Ann, and immediately after, the Council assumed the Administration and continued it until a Proclamation arrived from King George, by Virtue of which Governor Dudley reassumed the Government. It would be tedious to enumerate the Addresses, Votes and Messages of both the Council and House of Representatives to the same Purpose. I have said enough to shew that this Government has submitted to Parliament from a Conviction of it's constitutional Supremacy, and this not from Inconsideration, nor meerly from Reluctance at the Idea of contending with the Parent State.If then I have made it appear, that both by the first and second Charters we hold our Lands and the Authority of Government not of the King but of the Crown of England, that being a Dominion of the Crown of England, we are consequently subject to the Supreme Authority of England, that this hath been the Sense of this Plantation, except in those few Years when the Principles of Anarchy which had prevailed in the Kingdom had not lost their Influence here; andif, upon a Review of your Principles, they shall appear to you to have been delusive and erroneous, as I think they must, or if you shall only be in Doubt of them, you certainly will not draw that Conclusion which otherwise you might do, and which I am glad you have hitherto avoided; especially when you consider the obvious and inevitable Distress and Misery of Independence upon our Mother Country, if such Independence could be allowed or maintained, and the Probability of much greater Distress, which we are not able to foresee.You ask me if we have not Reason to fear we shall soon be reduced to a worse Situation than that of the Colonies of France, Spain or Holland. I may safely affirm that we have not; that we have no Reason to Fear any Evils from a Submission to the Authority of Parliament, equal to what we must feel from its Authority being disputed, from an uncertain Rule of Law and Government. For more than seventy Years together the Supremacy of Parliament was acknowledged without Complaints of Grievance. The Effect of every Measure cannot be foreseen by human Wisdom. What can be expected more from any Authority than when the Unfitness of a Measure is discovered, to make it void? When upon the united Representations and Complaints of the American Colonies any Acts have appeared to Parliament to be unsalutary, have there not been repeated Instances of the Repeal of such Acts? We cannot expect these Instances should be carried so far as to be equivalent to a Disavowal or Relinquishment of the Right itself. Why thenshall we fear for ourselves and our Posterity, greater rigour of Government for seventy Years to come than what we and our Predecessors have felt in the seventy Years past.You must give me Leave, Gentlemen, in a few Words to vindicate myself from a Charge, in one Part of your Answer, of having, by my Speech, reduced you to the unhappy Alternative of appearing by your Silence to acquiesce in my Sentiments, or of freely discussing this Point of the Supremacy of Parliament. I saw, as I have before observed, the Capital Town of the Province, without being reduced to such an Alternative, voluntarily not only discussing but determining this Point, and inviting every other Town and District in the Province to do the like. I saw that many of the principal Towns had followed the Example, and that there was imminent Danger of a Compliance in most if not all the Rest, in Order to avoid being distinguished. Was not I reduced to the Alternative of rendering myself justly obnoxious to the Displeasure of my Sovereign by acquiescing in such Irregularities, o• of calling upon you to join with me in suppressing them? Might I not rather have expected from you an Expression of your Concern that any Persons should project and prosecute a Plan of Measures which would lay me under a Necessity of bringing this Point before you? It was so far from being my Inclination, that nothing short of a Sense of •uty to the King, and the Obligations I am under to consult your true Interest could have compelled me to it.Gentlemen of the Council, and Gentlemen of the House of Representatives▪We all profess to be the loyal and dutiful Subjects of the King of Great-Britain. His Majesty considers the British Empire as one entire Dominion, subject to one Supreme Legislative Power, a due Submission to which is essential to the Maintenance of the Rights, Liberties and Privileges of the several Parts of this Dominion. We have abundant Evidence of his Majesty's tender and impartial Regard to the Rights of his Subjects; and I am authorized to say that "his Majesty will most graciously approve of every Constitutional Measure that may contribute to the Peace, the Happiness, and Prosperity of his Colony of Massachusetts-Bay, and which may have the Effect to shew to the World that he has no Wish beyond that of reigning in the Hearts and Affections of his People."
